      "\n",
      "1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):\n",
      "- ANN is a basic form of deep learning where the neurons are arranged in layers, and each neuron is connected to all neurons in the adjacent layers.\n",
      "- ANN is typically used for tasks such as regression, classification, and pattern recognition.\n",
      "- Example: Predicting housing prices based on features such as location, size, and number of bedrooms.\n",

      "2. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN):\n",
      "- BNN is a type of neural network that incorporates Bayesian inference techniques to model uncertainty in the network's parameters.\n",
      "- BNN is useful when dealing with limited data or when we want to quantify uncertainty in predictions.\n",
      "- Example: Predicting the probability of a customer clicking on an advertisement based on demographic data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):\n",
      "- CNN is designed to efficiently process grid-like data such as images and videos by leveraging spatial hierarchies of features.\n",
      "- CNN uses convolutional layers to extract features from the input data and pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions.\n",
      "- CNN is commonly used for image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation tasks.\n",
      "- Example: Identifying objects in an image and classifying them into predefined categories.\n",

      "4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):\n",

      "- RNN has loops in the network architecture that allow information to persist over time.\n",
