Machine learning is  often \\ncategorized as a subfield of artificial intelligence, but I find that categorization can often \\nbe misleading at first brush. The study of machine learning certainly arose from research \\nin this context, but in the  data science application of machine learning methods, it\\'s more \\nhelpful to think of machine learning as a means of building models of data. \\nFundamentally, machine learning involves building mathematical models to help \\nunderstand data. \"Learning\" enters the fray when we give these models tuna ble \\nparameters that can be adapted to observed data; in this way the program can be \\nconsidered to be \"learning\" from the data. Once these models have been fit to previously \\nseen data, they can be used to predict and understand aspects of newly observed dat a. I\\'ll \\nleave to the reader the more philosophical digression regarding the extent to which this \\ntype of mathematical, model -based \"learning\" is similar to the \"learning\" exhibited by the \\nhuman brain. these tools effectively, and so we will start with some  broad categorizations \\nof the types of approaches we\\'ll discuss here.'),\n",

SYSTEM ANALYSIS  \\n2.1 EXISTING SYSTEM  \\n           In an existing system, historical crime data can be collected from various sources \\nsuch as police records, crime reports, and surveys. This data can then be pre -processed \\nand analyzed using statistical and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and \\ntrends in crime rates. Factors such as time of day, day of the week, location, and type of \\ncrime can be analyzed to identify hotspots and high -risk areas. This information can be \\nused to allocate police resources more efficiently, identify areas that require more \\nsurveillance and control, and take preventive measures to reduce crime rates.  \\n2.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM  \\n            In a proposed system, real -time crime data can be collected using various sources \\nsuch as social media, CCTV cameras, and sensors. This data can then be pre -processed \\nand analyzed using advanced machine learning algorithms  identify patterns and trends \\nin crime rates.

System Design  \\n4.1 UML Diagrams  \\n               UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. UML is a standardized general -\\npurpose modeling language in the field of object -oriented software engineering. The \\nstandard is managed, and was created by, the Object Management Group.  \\n                    The goal is for UML to become a common language for creating models \\nof object oriented computer software. In its current form UML is comprised of two major \\ncomponents: a Meta -model and a notation. In the future, some form of method or p rocess \\nmay also be added to; or associated with, UML.  \\n                   The Unified Modeling Language is a standard language for specifying, \\nVisualization, Constructing and documenting the artifacts of software system, as well as \\nfor business modeling an d other non -software systems.  \\n             The UML represents a collection of best engineering practices that have proven \\nsuccessful in the modeling of large and complex systems.  \\n                The UML is a very important part of developing objects -orien ted software and \\nthe software development process. The UML uses mostly graphical notations to express \\nthe design of software  projects.  \\nUsages of UML Diagrams  \\nThe diagram can be used in many different fields including software engineering or \\nbusiness proce sses to strengthen efficiency .'),\n",

They specify the quality attribute of the software. Non -Functional \\nRequirements deal with issues like scalability, maintainability, performance, portability, \\nsecurit y, reliability, and many more. Non -Functional Requirements address vital issues \\nof quality for software systems.  \\nPortability :  \\n                     Portability determines how a system or its element can be launched within \\none environment or another. It us ually includes hardware, software, or other usage \\nplatform specifications. Put simply, it establishes how well actions performed via one \\nplatform are run on another. Also, it prescribes how well system elements may be \\naccessed and may interact from two dif ferent environments.  \\nReliability:  \\n                  Reliability specifies how likely the system or its element would run without \\na failure for a given period of time under predefined conditions. Traditionally, this \\nprobability is expressed in percentages. For instance, if the system has 85 percent \\nreliabili ty for a month, this means that during this month, under normal usage conditions, \\nthere’s an 85 percent chance that the system won’t experience critical failure.  \\nPerformance:  \\n                      Performance defines how fast a software system or a partic ular piece of it \\nresponds to certain users’ actions under a certain workload. In most cases, this metric \\nexplains how long a user must wait before the target operation happens (the page renders, \\na transaction is processed, etc.) given the overall number of  users at the moment.
