The space  complexity  can\\nbe  measured  using  experimental  method,  which  is done  by running  the\\nprogram  and  then  measuring  the  actual  space  occupied  by the  program\\nduring  execution.   But  this  is done  very  rarely.   We estimate  the  space\\ncomplexity of the  program  before  running  the  program.   \\nSpace  complexity  is the  sum  of the  following  components:\\n(i)Instruction  space:\\n   The  program  which  is written  by the  user  is the  source  program.\\nWhen  this  program  is compiled,  a  compiled  version  of the  program  is\\ngenerated.   For  executing  the  program  an  executable  version  of  the\\nprogram  is  generated.   The  space  occupied  by  these  three  when  the\\nprogram  is under  execution,  will account  for the  instruction  space.\\n(ii)Data  space:\\nThe  space  needed  by  the  constants,  simple  variables,  arrays,\\nstructures  and  other  data  structures  will account  for the  data  space.\\nThe  Data space  depends  on the  following  factors:\\n\\uf0b7Structure  size  – It  is  the  sum  of  the  size  of  component\\nvariables  of the  structure.\\n\\uf0b7Array  size – Total  size  of the  array  is the  product  of the  size\\nof the  data  type  and  the  number  of array  locations.\\n2(iii)Environment  stack  space:\\nThe Environment  stack  space  is used  for saving  information  needed\\nto resume  execution  of partially  completed  functions.   That  is whenever\\nthe  control  of the  program  is transferred  from  one  function  to another\\nduring  a  function  call,   then  the  values  of the  local  variable  of that\\nfunction  and  return  address  are  stored  in the  environment  stack.   This\\ninformation  is  retrieved  when  the  control  comes  back  to  the  same\\nfunction.\\nThe  environment  stack  space  depends  on the  following  factors:\\n\\uf0b7Return  address\\n\\uf0b7Values  of all local variables  and  formal  parameters.\\nThe  Total  space  occupied  by  the  program  during  the  execution  of the\\nprogram  is the  sum  of the  fixed space  and  the  variable  space.\\n(i)Fixed  space - The  space  occupied  by  the  instruction  space,\\nsimple  variables  and  constants.\\n(ii)Variable  space  – The  dynamically  allocated  space  to  the\\nvarious  data  structures  and  the  environment  stack  space  varies\\naccording  to the  input  from  the  user.\\nSpace  complexity  S(P)  =  c +  S p\\nc à Fixed  space  or constant  space\\nSp à Variable  space\\nWe will be  interested  in estimating  only the  variable  space  because  that\\nis the  one which  varies  according  to the  user  input.\\nTIME COMPLEXITY\\nTime  complexity:   Time  complexity  of the  program  is defined  as the\\namount  of computer  time  it needs  to run to completion.\\nThe  time  complexity  can  be  measured,  by  measuring  the  time\\ntaken  by  the  program  when  it  is  executed.   This  is  an  experimental\\nmethod.   But this is done  very rarely.   We always  try to estimate  the  time\\nconsumed  by the  program  even  before  it is run  for the  first  time.   \\nThe  time  complexity  of  the  program  depends  on  the  following\\nfactors:\\n\\uf0b7Compiler  used  – some  compilers  produce  optimized  code\\nwhich  consumes  less time  to get  executed.\\n\\uf0b7Compiler  options  – The optimization  options  can  be set  in the\\noptions  of the  compiler.\\n\\uf0b7Target  computer  – The  speed  of the  computer  or the  number\\nof  instructions  executed  per  second  differs  from  one\\ncomputer  to another.\\n3The  total  time  taken  for the  execution  of the  program  is the  sum  of the\\ncompilation  time  and  the  execution  time.\\n(i)Compile  time  – The  time  taken  for  the  compilation  of  the\\nprogram  to  produce  the  intermediate  object  code  or  the\\ncompiler  version  of the  program.   The compilation  time  is taken\\nonly  once  as  it is enough  if the  program  is compiled  once.   If\\noptimized  code  is to  be  generated,  then  the  compilation  time\\nwill be higher.\\n(ii)Run  time  or  Execution  time  -  The  time  taken  for  the\\nexecution  of the  program.   The  optimized  code  will take  less\\ntime  to get  executed.  \\nTime  complexity  T(P)  =  c +  T p\\nc à Compile  time\\nTp à Run time  or execution  time\\nWe will be interested  in estimating  only the  execution  time  as this  is the\\none which  varies  according  to the  user  input.\\nEstimating  the  Execution  time:\\nProgram  step:   Program  step  is a meaningful  segment  of a program\\nwhich  is  independent  of  instance  characteristics.   Instance\\ncharacteristics  are  the  variables  whose  values  are  decided  by the  user\\ninput  at that  instant  of time.\\nSteps  in estimating  the  execution  time  of program:\\n(i)Identify  one  or more  key operations  and  determine  the  number  of\\ntimes  these  are  performed.   That  is  find  out  how  many  key\\noperations  are  present  inside  a loop and  how  many  times  that  loop\\nis executed.\\n(ii)Determine  the  total number  of steps  executed  by the  program.\\nThe time  complexity will be proportional  to the  sum  of the  above  two.\\nASYMPTOTIC NOTATIONS\\nAsymptotic  notations  – Asymptotic  notations  are  the  notations  used  to\\ndescribe  the  behavior  of the  time  or space  complexity.\\nLet us represent  the  time  complexity  and  the  space  complexity  using  the\\ncommon  function  f(n).\\nThe various  asymptotic  notations  are:\\n(i)O ( Big Oh notation  )\\n4(ii) ( Omega  notation  )Ω\\n(iii) ( Theta  notation  )θ\\n(iv)o ( Little  Oh notation  )\\nO – Big Oh notation\\nThe big Oh notation  provides  an upper  bound  for the  function  f(n).\\nThe  function  f(n) =  O(g(n)) if and  only if there  exists  positive  constants\\nc and  n0 such  that  f(n)  cg(n) for all n  n ≤ ≥ 0.\\nExamples:\\n1.f(n) =  3n +  2 \\nLet us take  g(n) =  n\\n        c   =   4\\n        n0  =  2\\nLet us check  the  above  condition\\n3n +  1  4n    ≤for all n  2 ≥\\nThe condition  is satisfied.

There are two types of search\\ntechniques. They are:\\n1.Linear or sequential search\\n2.Binary search\\nSorting allows an efficient arrangement of elements within a given data structure. It is a way in which\\nthe elements are organized systematically for some purpose. For example, a dictionary in which\\nwords are arranged in alphabetical order and telephone director in which the subscriber names are\\nlisted in alphabetical order. There are many sorting techniques out of which we study the following.\\n1. Bubble sort\\n2. Quick sort\\n3. Selection sort and \\n4. Heap sort\\nLINEAR SEARCH\\nThis is the simplest of all searching techniques. In this technique, an ordered or unordered list will be\\nsearched one by one from the beginning until the desired element is found. If the desired element is\\nfound in the list then the search is successful otherwise unsuccessful. \\nSuppose there are ‘n ’ elements organized sequentially on a List. The number of comparisons\\nrequired to retrieve an element from the list, purely depends on where the element is stored in the list.\\nIf it is the first element, one comparison will do; if it is second element two comparisons are necessary\\nand so on. On an average you need [(n+1)/2] comparison’s to search an element. If search is not\\nsuccessful, you would need ’n ’ comparisons.\\nThe time complexity of linear search is O(n).\\nAlgorithm:\\nLet array a[n] stores n elements. Determine whether element ‘x’ is present or not.\\nlinsrch(a[n], x) \\n{\\nindex = 0;\\nflag = 0;\\nwhile (index < n) do\\n{ \\nif (x == a[index]) \\n{\\nflag = 1;\\nbreak;\\n}\\nindex ++;\\n}\\nif(flag == 1)\\nprintf(“Data found  at %d position“, index);\\nelse\\nprintf(“data not found”);\\n}\\n7Example 1:\\nSuppose we have the following unsorted list: 45, 39, 8, 54, 77, 38, 24, 16, 4, 7, 9, 20\\nIf we are searching for: 45, we’ll look at 1 element before success\\n39, we’ll look at 2 elements before success\\n8, we’ll look at 3 elements before success\\n54, we’ll look at 4 elements before success\\n77, we’ll look at 5 elements before success\\n38 we’ll look at 6 elements before success\\n24, we’ll look at 7 elements before success\\n16, we’ll look at 8 elements before success\\n4, we’ll look at 9 elements before success\\n7, we’ll look at 10 elements before success\\n9, we’ll look at 11 elements before success\\n20, we’ll look at 12 elements before success\\nFor any element not in the list, we’ll look at 12 elements before failure\\nExample 2:\\nLet us illustrate linear search on the following 9 elements:\\nIndex012345678\\nElements-15-6079235482101\\nSearching different elements is as follows:\\n1.

When we are given a\\nelement ‘x’, binary search is used to find the corresponding element from the list. In case ‘x’ is\\npresent, we have to determine a value ‘j’ such that a[j] = x (successful search). If ‘x’ is not in the list\\nthen j is to set to zero (un successful search).\\nIn Binary search we jump into the middle of the file, where we find key a[mid], and compare ‘x’ with\\na[mid].  If x = a[mid]  then the desired record has been found.           If x < a[mid] then ‘x’ must be in\\nthat portion of the file that precedes a[mid]. Similarly, if a[mid] > x, then further search is only\\nnecessary in that part of the file which follows a[mid]. If we use recursive procedure of finding the\\nmiddle key a[mid] of the un-searched portion of a file, then every un-successful comparison of ‘x’ with\\na[mid] will eliminate roughly half the un-searched portion from consideration. \\nSince the array size is roughly halved after each comparison between ‘x’ and a[mid], and since an\\narray of length ‘n’ can be halved only about log 2n times before reaching a trivial length, the worst case\\ncomplexity of Binary search is about log 2n \\nAlgorithm:\\n9Let array a[n] of elements in increasing order, n \\uf0b3 0, determine whether ‘x’ is present, and if so, set j\\nsuch that x = a[j] else return 0.\\nbinsrch(a[], n, x) \\n{\\nlow = 1; high = n; \\nwhile (low < high) do\\n{ \\nmid = \\uf0eb (low + high)/2 \\uf0eb\\nif (x < a[mid])  \\nhigh = mid – 1;\\nelse if (x > a[mid]) \\nlow = mid + 1;\\nelse return mid;\\n}\\nreturn 0;\\n }\\nlow and high are integer variables such that each time through the loop either ‘x’ is found or low is\\nincreased by at least one or high is decreased by at least one. Thus we have two sequences of\\nintegers approaching each other and eventually  low will become greater than  high causing\\ntermination in a finite number of steps if ‘x’ is not present. \\nExample 1:\\nLet us illustrate binary search on the following 12 elements:\\nIndex123456789101112\\nElements47891620243839455477\\nIf we are searching for x = 4: (This needs 3 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 1, high = 5, mid = 6/2 = 3, check 8\\nlow = 1, high = 2, mid = 3/2 = 1, check 4, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 7: (This needs 4 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 1, high = 5, mid = 6/2 = 3, check 8\\nlow = 1, high = 2, mid = 3/2 = 1, check 4\\nlow = 2, high = 2, mid = 4/2 = 2, check 7, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 8: (This needs 2 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 1, high = 5, mid = 6/2 = 3, check 8 , found\\nIf we are searching for x = 9: (This needs 3 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 1, high = 5, mid = 6/2 = 3, check 8\\nlow = 4, high = 5, mid = 9/2 = 4, check 9, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 16: (This needs 4 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 1, high = 5, mid = 6/2 = 3, check 8\\nlow = 4, high = 5, mid = 9/2 = 4, check 9\\nlow = 5, high = 5, mid = 10/2 = 5, check 16, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 20: (This needs 1 comparison)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 24: (This needs 4 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 7, high = 12, mid = 19/2 = 9, check 39\\nlow = 7, high = 10, mid = 17/2 = 8, check 38\\n10low = 7, high = 7, mid = 14/2 = 7, check 24, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 38: (This needs 3 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 7, high = 12, mid = 19/2 = 9, check 39\\nlow = 7, high = 10, mid = 17/2 = 8, check 38, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 39: (This needs 2 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 7, high = 12, mid = 19/2 = 9, check 39, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 45: (This needs 4 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 7, high = 12, mid = 19/2 = 9, check 39\\nlow = 10, high = 12, mid = 22/2 = 11, check 54\\nlow = 10, high = 10, mid = 20/2 = 10, check 45, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 54: (This needs 3 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 7, high = 12, mid = 19/2 = 9, check 39\\nlow = 10, high = 12, mid = 22/2 = 11, check 54, found\\nIf we are searching for x = 77: (This needs 4 comparisons)\\nlow = 1, high = 12, mid = 13/2 = 6, check 20\\nlow = 7, high = 12, mid = 19/2 = 9, check 39\\nlow = 10, high = 12, mid = 22/2 = 11, check 54\\nlow = 12, high = 12, mid = 24/2 = 12, check 77, found\\nThe number of comparisons necessary by search element:\\n20 – requires 1 comparison; 8 and 39 – requires 2 comparisons; \\n4, 9, 38, 54 – requires 3 comparisons; and 7, 16, 24, 45, 77 – requires 4 comparisons\\nSumming the comparisons, needed to find all twelve items and dividing by 12, yielding 37/12 or\\napproximately 3.08 comparisons per successful search on the average. \\nExample 2:\\nLet us illustrate binary search on the following 9 elements:\\nIndex123456789\\nElements-15-6079235482101\\nThe number of comparisons required for searching different elements is as follows:\\n1.

The basic idea of bubble sort is to pass through\\nthe file sequentially several times. In each pass, we compare each element in the file with its\\n13successor i.e., X[i] with X[i+1] and interchange two element when they are not in proper order. We will\\nillustrate this sorting technique by taking a specific example. Bubble sort is also called as exchange\\nsort.\\nConsider the array x[n] which is stored in memory as shown below: \\nX[0]X[1]X[2]X[3]X[4]X[5]\\n334422116655\\nSuppose we want our array to be stored in ascending order. Then we pass through the array 5 times\\nas described below: \\nPass 1: (first element is compared with all other elements)\\nWe compare X[i] and X[i+1] for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and interchange X[i] and X[i+1] if X[i] > X[i+1]. The\\nprocess is shown below: \\nX[0]X[1]X[2]X[3]X[4]X[5]Remarks\\n334422116655\\n2244\\n1144\\n4466\\n5566\\n332211445566\\nThe biggest number 66 is moved to (bubbled up) the right most position in the array.\\nPass 2: (second element is compared)\\nWe repeat the same process, but this time we don’t include X[5] into our comparisons. i.e., we\\ncompare X[i] with X[i+1] for i=0, 1, 2, and 3 and interchange X[i] and X[i+1] if X[i] > X[i+1]. The\\nprocess is shown below: \\nX[0]X[1]X[2]X[3]X[4]Remarks\\n3322114455\\n2233\\n1133\\n3344\\n4455\\n2211334455\\nThe second biggest number 55 is moved now to X[4].\\nPass 3: (third element is compared)\\nWe repeat the same process, but this time we leave both X[4] and X[5]. By doing this, we move the\\nthird biggest number 44 to X[3].\\nX[0]X[1]X[2]X[3]Remarks\\n22113344\\n1122\\n142233\\n3344\\n11223344\\nPass 4: (fourth element is compared)\\nWe repeat the process leaving X[3], X[4], and X[5]. By doing this, we move the fourth biggest number\\n33 to X[2].\\nX[0]X[1]X[2]Remarks\\n112233\\n1122\\n2233\\nPass 5: (fifth element is compared)\\nWe repeat the process leaving X[2], X[3], X[4], and X[5]. By doing this, we move the fifth biggest\\nnumber 22 to X[1]. At this time, we will have the smallest number 11 in X[0]. Thus, we see that we\\ncan sort the array of size 6 in 5 passes. \\nFor an array of size n, we required (n-1) passes. \\nProgram for Bubble Sort:\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n#include <conio.h>\\nvoid bubblesort(int x[],int n)\\n{\\nint i,  j,  t;\\nfor (i = 0; i < n; i++)\\n{\\nfor (j = 0; j <n-i; j++)\\n{\\nif (x[j] > x[j+1])\\n{\\nt = x[j];\\nx[j] = x[j+1];\\nx[j+1] = t;\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n}\\nmain()\\n{\\nint i, n, x[25];\\nclrscr();\\nprintf(\"\\\\n Enter the number of elements: \");\\nscanf(\"%d\",&n);\\nprintf(\"\\\\n Enter Data:\");\\nfor(i = 0; i < n ; i++)\\nscanf(\"%d\", &x[i]);\\nbubblesort(x,n);\\nprintf (\"\\\\nArray Elements after sorting: \");\\nfor (i = 0; i < n; i++)\\n15printf (\"%5d\", x[i]);\\n}\\nTime Complexity:\\nThe bubble sort method of sorting an array of size n requires (n-1) passes and (n-1) comparisons on\\neach pass. Thus the total number of comparisons is (n-1) * (n-1) = n 2 – 2n + 1, which is O(n 2).\\nTherefore bubble sort is very inefficient when there are more elements to sorting. \\nSelection Sort:\\nNow, you will learn another sorting technique, which is more efficient than bubble sort and the\\ninsertion sort. This sort, as you will see, will not require no more than n-1 interchanges. The sort we\\nare talking about is selection sort.\\nSuppose x is an array of size n stored in memory. The selection sort algorithm first selects the\\nsmallest element in the array x and place it at array position 0; then it selects the next smallest\\nelement in the array x and place it at array position 1. It simply continues this procedure until it places\\nthe biggest element in the last position of the array. We will now present to you an algorithm for\\nselection sort. \\nThe array is passed through (n-1) times and the smallest element is placed in its respective position\\nin the array as detailed below: \\nPass 1:\\nFind the location j of the smallest element in the array x [0], x[1], . . . . x[n-1], and then interchange x[j]\\nwith x[0]. Then x[0] is sorted. \\nPass 2:\\nLeave the first element and find the location j of the smallest element in the sub-array x[1], x[2], . . . .\\nx[n-1], and then interchange x[1] with x[j]. Then x[0], x[1] are sorted.\\nPass 3: \\nLeave the first two elements and find the location j of the smallest element in the sub-array x[2], x[3], .\\n. . . x[n-1], and then interchange x[2] with x[j]. Then x[0], x[1], x[2] are sorted.\\nPass (n-1):\\nFind the location j of the smaller of the elements x[n-2] and x[n-1], and then interchange x[j] and x[n-\\n2]. Then x[0], x[1], . . . . x[n-2] are sorted. Of course, during this pass x[n-1] will be the biggest\\nelement and so the entire array is sorted. \\nTime Complexity:\\nIn general we prefer selection sort in case where the insertion sort or the bubble sort requires\\nexclusive swapping.

The  insertion  sort  algorithm  scans  A\\nfrom  A[1] to A[N], inserting  each  element  A[K] into its proper  position  in\\nthe  previously sorted  subarray  A[1], A[2],..A[K-1].\\nPrinciple:  In Insertion  Sort  algorithm,  each  element  A[K] in the  list is\\ncompared  with  all  the  elements  before  it  ( A[1]  to  A[K-1]).   If  any\\nelement  A[I] is found  to be  greater  than  A[K] then  A[K] is inserted  in\\nthe  place  of  A[I}.   This  process  is repeated  till all the  elements  are\\nsorted.\\nAlgorithm:\\n18Procedure  INSERTIONSORT(A,  N)\\n// A is the  array  containing  the  list of data  items\\n// N is the  number  of data  items  in the  list\\nLast  ß N – 1\\nRepeat  For Pass  =  1 to Last  Step  1\\nRepeat  For I =  0 to Pass  – 1 Step  1\\nIf A[Pass]  <  A[I]\\nThen\\nTemp  ß A[Pass]\\nRepeat  For J =  Pass  -1 to I Step  -1\\nA[J +1]  ß A[J]\\nEnd Repeat\\nA[I] ß Temp\\nEnd If\\nEnd Repeat\\nEnd Repeat\\nEnd INSERTIONSORT\\nIn  Insertion  Sort  algorithm,  Last is  made  to  point  to  the  last\\nelement  in the  list and  Pass is made  to point  to the  second  element  in the\\nlist.  In every  pass  the  Pass is incremented  to point  to the  next  element\\nand  is  continued  till  it  reaches  the  last  element.   During  each  pass\\nA[Pass]  is compared  all elements  before  it.  If A[Pass]  is lesser  than  A[I]\\nin the  list, then  A[Pass]  is inserted  in position  I.  Finally,  a sorted  list is\\nobtained.\\nFor  performing  the  insertion  operation,  a variable  temp  is used  to\\nsafely store  A[Pass]  in it and  then  shift  right  elements  starting  from  A[I]\\nto A[Pass-1].\\nExample:\\nN =  10 à Number  of elements  in the  list\\nL à Last\\nP à Pass\\ni =  0i =1i =  2i =  3i =  4i =  5i =  6i =  7i =  8i =  9\\n42237411655894369987\\nP=1A[P] < A[0] à Insert  A[P] at 0 L=9\\n23427411655894369987\\nP=2 L=9\\nA[P] is greater  than  all elements  before  it.

The  first  pass  starts  with  the  variable  pass\\npointing  to the  second  element  and  continues  till  pass reaches  the  last\\nelement.   In each  pass,  a[pass]  is compared  with  all the  elements  before\\nit and  if a[pass]  is lesser  than  a[i], then  it is inserted  in position  i.  Before\\ninserting  it,  the  elements  a[i]  to  a[pass-1]  are  shifted  right  using  a\\ntemporary  variable.\\nAdvantages:\\n1.Sorts  the  list faster  when  the  list has  less number  of elements.  \\n2.Efficient  in cases  where  a new  element  has  to be  inserted  into  a\\nsorted  list. \\nDisadvantages:\\n1.Very slow for large  values  of n. \\n2.Poor  performance  if the  list is in almost  reverse  order.  \\n21Quick Sort\\n \\nThe quick sort was invented by Prof. C. A. R. Hoare in the early 1960’s. It was one of the first more\\nefficient sorting algorithms. It is an example of a class of algorithms that work by what is usually called\\n“divide and conquer”.\\nIn essence, the quick sort algorithm partitions the original array by rearranging it into two groups. The\\nfirst group contains those elements less than some arbitrary chosen value taken from the set, and the\\nsecond group contains those elements greater than or equal to the chosen value.\\nThe chosen value is known as the pivot element. Once the array has been rearranged in this way with\\nrespect to the pivot, the very same partitioning is recursively applied to each of the two subsets.\\nWhen all the subsets have been partitioned and rearranged, the original array is sorted.\\nThe function partition() makes use of two pointers up and down which are moved toward each other\\nin the following fashion:\\n1.Repeatedly increase the pointer up by one position until a[up] > =pivot.\\n2.Repeatedly decrease the pointer down by one position until a[down] <=pivot.\\n3.If down > up, interchange a[down] with a[up]\\n4.Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3 till the ‘up’ pointer crosses the ‘down’ pointer. If ‘up’ pointer\\ncrosses ‘down’ pointer, the position for pivot is found and place pivot element in ‘down’\\npointer position.\\nThe program uses a recursive function quicksort(). The algorithm of quick sort function sorts all\\nelements in an array ‘a’ between positions ‘low’ and ‘high’.\\n1.It terminates when the condition low >= high is satisfied. This condition will be satisfied\\nonly when the array is completely sorted.\\n2.Here we choose the first element as the ‘pivot’. So, pivot = x[low]. Now it calls the\\npartition function to find the proper position j of the element x[low] i.e. pivot. Then we will\\nhave two sub-arrays x[low], x[low+1], . . . . . . . x[j-1] and x[j+1], x[j+2], . . .x[high].\\n3.It calls itself recursively to sort the left sub-array  x[low], x[low+1], . . . . . . . x[j-1] between\\npositions low and j-1 (where j is returned by the partition function).\\n4.It calls itself recursively to sort the right sub-array x[j+1], x[j+2], . . .x[high] between\\npositions j+1 and high.\\nAlgorithm\\nSorts the elements a[p], . . . . . ,a[q] which reside in the global array a[n] into ascending order. The a[n\\n+ 1] is considered to be defined and must be greater than all elements in a[n]; a[n + 1] = + \\uf0b5 \\nquicksort (p, q)\\n{\\nif ( p < q ) then\\n{\\ncall j = PARTITION(a, p, q+1);     // j is the position of the partitioning element\\ncall quicksort(p, j – 1);\\ncall quicksort(j + 1 , q);\\n}\\n}\\npartition(a, m, p)\\n{\\nv = a[m]; up = m; down =  p; // a[m] is the partition element \\ndo\\n{\\n22repeat  \\nup = up + 1; \\nuntil (a[up] > v);\\nrepeat  \\ndown = down – 1;\\nuntil (a[down] < v);\\nif (up < down) then call interchange(a, up, down);\\n } while (up > down);\\na[m] = a[down]; \\na[down] = v;    \\nreturn (down);\\n}\\ninterchange(a, up, down)\\n{\\np = a[up];\\na[up] = a[down]; \\na[down] = p;\\n}\\nTime complexity: \\nThere are several choices for choosing the ‘pivot’ element through which we can improve the\\nefficiency of quick sort. For example, one may choose the ‘pivot’ element as median or mean or\\nmiddle element. Also, a non-recursive method could be developed for execution efficiency. When\\nthese improvements are made, experiments indicate the fact that the total number of comparisons for\\nquick sort is of O(n log n).\\nExample:\\nSelect first element as the pivot element. Move ‘up’ pointer from left to right in search of an element\\nlarger than pivot. Move the ‘down’ pointer from right to left in search of an element smaller than pivot.\\nIf such elements are found, the elements are swapped. This process continues till the ‘up’ pointer\\ncrosses the ‘down’ pointer. If ‘up’ pointer crosses ‘down’ pointer, the position for pivot is found and\\ninterchange pivot and element at ‘down’ position. \\nLet us consider the following example with 13 elements to analyze quick sort: \\n12345678910111213Remarks\\n38081606795724560258047045\\npivot updow\\nnswap up\\n& down \\n04 79\\nupdow\\nnswap up\\n& down \\n02 57\\ndow\\nnup\\n(240816060402)38(565758797045)swap\\npivot &\\ndown\\npivotdow\\nnswap\\npivot &\\ndown\\n(0208160604)24\\npivot,\\ndownup swap\\npivot &\\n23down\\n02(08160604)\\npivotupdow\\nnswap up\\n& down\\n0416\\ndow\\nnUp\\n(0604)08  \\n(16)swap\\npivot &\\ndown\\npivot\\n,\\ndow\\nnup\\n(04)06swap\\npivot &\\ndown\\n04\\npivot\\n,\\ndow\\nn\\n16\\npivot\\n,\\ndow\\nn\\n(020406081624)38\\n(565758797045)\\npivotupdow\\nnswap up\\n& down\\n45 57\\ndow\\nnup\\n(45)56(58797057)swap\\npivot &\\ndown\\n45\\npivot\\n,\\ndow\\nnswap\\npivot &\\ndown\\n(58\\npivot79\\nup7057)\\ndow\\nnswap up\\n& down\\n5779\\ndow\\nnup\\n(57)58(7079)swap\\npivot &\\ndown\\n57\\npivot\\n,\\ndow\\nn\\n(7079)\\npivot\\n,\\ndow\\nnupswap\\npivot &\\ndown\\n70\\n79\\npivot\\n,\\ndow\\n24n\\n(455657587079)\\n02040608162438455657587079\\nProgram for Quick Sort (Recursive version):\\n# include<stdio.h>\\n# include<conio.h>\\nvoid quicksort(int, int);\\nint partition(int, int);\\nvoid interchange(int, int);\\nint array[25];\\nint main()\\n{\\nint num, i = 0;\\nclrscr();\\nprintf( \"Enter the number of elements: \" );\\nscanf( \"%d\", &num);\\nprintf( \"Enter the elements: \" );\\nfor(i=0; i < num; i++)\\nscanf( \"%d\", &array[i] );\\nquicksort(0, num -1);\\nprintf( \"\\\\nThe elements after sorting are: \" );\\nfor(i=0; i < num; i++)\\nprintf(\"%d  \", array[i]);\\nreturn 0;\\n}\\nvoid quicksort(int low, int high)\\n{\\nint pivotpos;\\nif( low < high )\\n{\\npivotpos = partition(low, high + 1);\\nquicksort(low, pivotpos - 1);\\nquicksort(pivotpos + 1, high);\\n}\\n}\\nint partition(int low, int high)\\n{\\nint pivot = array[low];\\nint up = low, down = high;\\ndo\\n{\\ndo\\nup = up + 1;\\nwhile(array[up] < pivot );\\ndo\\ndown = down - 1;\\nwhile(array[down] > pivot);\\nif(up < down) \\ninterchange(up, down);\\n}while(up < down);\\n25array[low] = array[down];\\narray[down] = pivot;\\nreturn down;\\n}\\nvoid interchange(int i, int j)\\n{\\nint temp;\\ntemp = array[i];\\narray[i] = array[j];\\narray[j] = temp;\\n}\\nHeap and Heap Sort\\nHeap is a data structure, which permits one to insert elements into a set and also to find the largest\\nelement efficiently. A data structure, which provides these two operations, is called a priority queue. \\nMax and Min Heap data structures:\\nA max heap is an almost complete binary tree such that the value of each node is greater than or\\nequal to those in its children. \\nMax heap Min heap 95 \\n85 \\n75 25 45 \\n15 35 45 \\n55 15 \\n65 35 25 \\n75 \\n55 65 85 95 \\nA min heap is an almost complete binary tree such that the value of each node is less than or equal to\\nthose in its children. \\nRepresentation of Heap Tree:\\nSince heap is a complete binary tree, a heap tree can be efficiently represented using one\\ndimensional array. This provides a very convenient way of figuring out where children belong to. \\n\\uf0b7The root of the tree is in location 1. \\n\\uf0b7The left child of an element stored at location i can be found in location 2* i. \\n\\uf0b7The right child of an element stored at location i can be found in location 2* i+1. \\n\\uf0b7The parent of an element stored at location i can be found at location floor(i/2). \\nThe elements of the array can be thought of as lying in a tree structure.  A heap tree represented\\nusing a single array looks as follows:\\nX[1]X[2]X[3]X[4]X[5]X[6]X[7]X[8]\\n6545604025505530\\n \\n2625 55 60 \\n50 65 \\n45 \\n30 40 x[ 1] \\nx[ 3] \\nx[ 7] x[ 6] x[ 2] \\nx[ 5] x[ 4] \\nx[ 8] Heap Tree \\nOperations on heap tree:\\nThe major operations required to be performed on a heap tree: \\n1.Insertion, \\n2.Deletion and \\n3.Merging. \\nInsertion into a heap tree:\\nThis operation is used to insert a node into an existing heap tree satisfying the properties of heap\\ntree. Using repeated insertions of data, starting from an empty heap tree, one can build up a heap\\ntree. \\nLet us consider the heap (max) tree. The principle of insertion is that, first we have to adjoin the data\\nin the complete binary tree. Next, we have to compare it with the data in its parent; if the value is\\ngreater than that at parent then interchange the values. This will continue between two nodes on path\\nfrom the newly inserted node to the root node till we get a parent whose value is greater than its child\\nor we reached the root. \\nFor illustration, 35 is added as the right child of 80. Its value is compared with its parent’s value, and\\nto be a max heap, parent’s value greater than child’s value is satisfied, hence interchange as well as\\nfurther comparisons are no more required. \\nAs another illustration, let us consider the case of insertion 90 into the resultant heap tree. First, 90\\nwill be added as left child of 40, when 90 is compared with 40 it requires interchange. Next, 90 is\\ncompared with 80, another interchange takes place. Now, our process stops here, as 90 is now in\\nroot node. The path on which these comparisons and interchanges have taken places are shown by\\ndashed line. \\nThe algorithm Max_heap_insert to insert a data into a max heap tree is as follows:\\nMax_heap_insert (a, n)\\n{\\n//inserts the value in a[n] into the heap which is stored at a[1] to a[n-1]\\n \\ninteger i, n;\\ni = n;  \\nitem = a[n]  ; \\nwhile ( (i > 1) and (a[ \\uf0eb i/2 \\uf0eb ] < item ) do \\n{\\na[i] = a[ \\uf0eb i/2 \\uf0eb ] ; // move the parent down\\ni = \\uf0eb i/2 \\uf0eb  ;\\n}\\na[i] = item ;\\nreturn true ;\\n}\\nExample:\\nForm a heap by using the above algorithm for the given data 40, 80, 35, 90, 45, 50, 70.\\n2740 40 \\n80 80 \\n40 1.

The last node is 26, it is in the level 3. So, 99 is replaced by 26 and this\\nnode with data 26 is removed from the tree. Next 26 at root node is compared with its two child 45\\nand 63. As 63 is greater, they are interchanged. Now, 26 is compared with its children, namely, 57\\nand 42, as 57 is greater, so they are interchanged. Now, 26 appears as the leave node, hence re-\\nheap is completed. \\n99 \\n45 63 \\n35 57 42 29 \\n27 12 24 26 63 \\n45 57 \\n35 26 42 29 \\n27 12 24 26 63 \\n26 57 \\n26 \\nDelet ing t he node wit h dat a 99  Aft er Delet ion of node wit h dat a 99  \\nHEAP SORT:\\nA heap sort algorithm works by first organizing the data to be sorted into a special type of binary tree\\ncalled a heap. Any kind of data can be sorted either in ascending order or in descending order using\\nheap tree. It does this with the following steps: \\n1.Build a heap tree with the given set of data. \\n2.a.Remove the top most item (the largest) and replace it with the last\\nelement in the heap. \\nb.Re-heapify the complete binary tree. \\nc.Place the deleted node in the output. \\n3.Continue step 2 until the heap tree is empty. \\nAlgorithm:\\nThis algorithm sorts the elements a[n].

These  subfiles  are  sorted  using  the\\nalgorithm  recursively  and  then  the  two  subfiles  are merged  together  to\\nobtain  the  sorted  file.  \\nGiven  a sequence  of n elements  A[1], ….A[N], the  general  idea  is to\\nimagine  them  split  into  two  sets  A[1],…A[N/2]  and  A[(N/2)  +  1],…A[N].\\nEach  set  is individually  sorted,  and  the  resulting  sorted  sequences  are\\nmerged  to produce  a single  sorted  sequence  of N elements.

Initially, the  index  variable  I points  to low and  J points  to\\nmid  +  1.  A[I] is compared  with  A[J] and  if A[I] found  to be  lesser  than\\nA[J]  then  A[I]  is  stored  in  a  temporary  array  and  I is  incremented\\notherwise  A[J] is stored  in  the  temporary  array  and  J is incremented.\\nThis comparison  is continued  until either  I crosses  mid or J crosses  high.\\nIf I crosses  the  mid first then  that  implies  that  all the  elements  in first  list\\nis  accommodated  in  the  temporary  array  and  hence  the  remaining\\nelements  in the  second  list can  be put  into the  temporary  array  as it is.  If\\nJ crosses  the  high  first  then  the  remaining  elements  of first  list is put  as\\nit is in the  temporary  array.   After  this process  we get  a single  sorted  list.\\nSince  this  method  merges  2 lists  at  a time,  this  is called  2-way  merge\\nsort.\\n \\nIn the  MERGESORT  algorithm,  the  given  unsorted  list is first  split\\ninto  N number  of lists,  each  list consisting  of only 1 element.   Then  the\\nMERGE  algorithm  is applied  for  first  2 lists  to get  a single  sorted  list.\\nThen  the  same  thing  is done  on the  next  two lists and  so on.  This process\\nis continued  till a single  sorted  list is obtained.\\nExample:\\nLet L à low, Mà mid, H à high\\ni =  0i =1i =  2i =  3i =  4i =  5i =  6i =  7i =  8i =  9\\n42237411655894369987\\nU M H\\nIn each  pass  the  mid value  is calculated  and  based  on that  the  list is split\\ninto  two.   This  is done  recursively  and  at  last  N  number  of lists  each\\nhaving  only one  element  is produced  as shown.\\n36Now  merging  operation  is called  on  first  two  lists  to  produce  a single\\nsorted  list, then  the  same  thing  is done  on the  next  two  lists  and  so on.\\nFinally a single  sorted  list is obtained.\\nProgram:\\nvoid array::sort(int  low, int high)\\n{\\nint mid;\\nif (low<high)\\n{\\nmid=(low+high)/2;\\nsort(low,mid);\\nsort(mid+1,  high);\\nmerge(low,  mid, high);\\n}\\n}\\nvoid array::merge(int  low, int mid, int high)\\n{\\nint i=low,  j=mid+1,  k=low,  temp[MAX];\\nwhile (i<=mid  && j<=high)\\nif (a[i]<a[j])\\ntemp[k++]=a[i++];\\nelse\\ntemp[k++]=a[j++];\\nif (i>mid)\\nwhile (j<=high)\\ntemp[k++]=a[j++];\\nelse\\nwhile (i<=mid)\\ntemp[k++]=a[i++];\\n37for (k=low;  k<=high;  k++)\\na[k]=temp[k];\\n}\\nAdvantages:\\n1.Very useful for sorting  bigger  lists. \\n2.Applicable  for external  sorting  also. \\nDisadvantages:\\n1.Needs  a  temporary  array  every  time,  for  storing  the  new  sorted\\nlist. \\nshell Sort\\nThe shell  sort,  sometimes  called  the  “diminishing  increment  sort,”\\nimproves  on the  insertion  sort  by breaking  the  original  list into a number\\nof smaller  sublists,  each  of which  is sorted  using  an  insertion  sort.  The\\nunique  way  that  these  sublists  are  chosen  is the  key  to  the  shell  sort.\\nInstead  of breaking  the  list  into  sublists  of contiguous  items,  the  shell\\nsort  uses  an increment  i, sometimes  called  the  gap, to create  a sublist  by\\nchoosing  all items  that  are  i items  apart.\\nExample  of shell Sort  : Use  Shell sort  for the  following  array  : 18, 32, 12,\\n5, 38, 30, 16, 2\\nCompare  the  elements  at a gap  of 4. i.e 18 with  38 and  so on and  swap  if\\nfirst  number  is greater  than  second.\\n38Compare  the  elements  at a gap  of 2 i.e 18 with 12 and  so on.\\nNow  the  gap  is 1. So now use  insertion  sort  to sort  this array.\\nAfter  insertion  sort.  The final array  is sorted.\\n39UNIT-II\\nSTACKS\\nThe  data  structures  seen  so  far,  allows  insertion  and  deletion  of\\nelements  at  any  place.   But  sometimes  it  is  required  to  permit  the\\naddition  and  deletion  of elements  only  at  one  end  that  is either  at  the\\nbeginning  or at the  end.   \\nStacks:  A stack  is a data  structure  in which  addition  of new  element\\nor deletion  of an existing  element  always  takes  place  at the  same  end.\\nThis  end  is often  known  as top  of stack.   When  an item  is added  to a\\nstack,  the  operation  is called  push,  and  when  an item  is removed  from\\nthe  stack  the  operation  is called  pop.   Stack  is also  called  as Last-In-\\nFirst-Out (LIFO) list.\\nOperations  on  Stack:\\nThere  are  two  possible  operations  done  on a stack.   They  are  pop\\nand  push  operation.   \\n\\uf0b7Push:  Allows  adding  an element  at the  top of the  stack.  \\n\\uf0b7Pop:  Allows  removing  an element  from  the  top of the  stack.  \\nThe  Stack  can  be  implemented  using  both  arrays  and  linked  lists.\\nWhen  dynamic  memory  allocation  is preferred  we  go  for  linked  lists  to\\nimplement  the  stacks.\\nARRAY IMPLEMENTATION  OF THE STACK\\nPush  operation:\\nIf the  elements  are  added  continuously  to the  stack  using  the  push\\noperation  then  the  stack  grows  at  one  end.   Initially  when  the  stack  is\\nempty  the  top  =  -1.  The top  is a variable  which  indicates  the  position  of\\nthe  topmost  element  in the  stack.\\n40PUSH(x)\\nIf top =  MAX – 1\\nThen\\nPrint  “Stack  is full”\\nReturn\\nElse\\nTop =  top +  1\\nA[top] =  x\\nEnd if\\nEnd PUSH(  )\\nPop  operation:\\nOn deletion  of elements  the  stack  shrinks  at  the  same  end,  as  the\\nelements  at the  top get  removed.\\nPOP(  )\\nIf top =  -1 \\nThen\\nPrint  “Stack  is empty”\\nReturn\\nElse\\nItem  =  A[top]\\nA[Top] =  0\\nTop =  top – 1\\nReturn  item\\nEnd if\\nEnd POP( )\\nIf arrays  are  used  for  implementing  the  stacks,  it would  be  very\\neasy  to manage  the  stacks.   However,  the  problem  with  an  array  is that\\nwe  are  required  to  declare  the  size  of the  array  before  using  it  in  a\\nprogram.   This  means  the  size  of the  stack  should  be  fixed.   We  can\\ndeclare  the  array  with  a maximum  size large  enough  to manage  a stack.   \\nAs result,  the  stack  can  grow  or shrink  within  the  space  reserved  for it.\\nThe following  program  implements  the  stack  using  array.\\nProgram:\\n41// Stack  and  various  operations  on it\\n#include  <iostream.h>\\n#include  <conio.h>\\nconst  int MAX=20;\\nclass  stack\\n{\\nprivate:\\nint a[MAX];\\nint top;\\npublic:\\nstack();\\nvoid push(int  x);\\nint pop();\\nvoid display();\\n};\\nstack::stack()\\n{\\ntop=- 1;\\n}\\nvoid stack::push(int  x)\\n{\\nif (top==MAX-1)\\n{\\ncout<<\"\\\\nStack  is full!\";\\nreturn;\\n}\\nelse\\n{\\ntop++;\\na[top]=x;\\n}\\n}\\nint stack::pop()\\n{\\nif (top==- 1)\\n{\\ncout<<\"\\\\nStack  is empty!\";\\nreturn  NULL;\\n}\\nelse\\n{\\nint item=a[top];\\ntop--;\\nreturn  item;\\n42}\\n}\\nvoid stack::display()\\n{\\nint temp=top;\\nwhile (temp!=- 1)\\ncout<<\"\\\\n\"<<a[temp- -];\\n}\\nvoid main()\\n{\\nclrscr();\\nstack  s;\\nint n;\\ns.push(10);\\ns.push(20);\\ns.push(30);\\ns.push(40);\\ns.display();\\nn=s.pop();\\ncout<<\"\\\\nPopped  item:\"<<n;\\nn=s.pop();\\ncout<<\"\\\\nPopped  item:\"<<n;\\ns.display();\\ngetch();\\n}\\nOutput:\\n40\\n30\\n20\\n10\\nPopped  item:40\\nPopped  item:30\\n20\\n10\\n LINKED  LIST IMPLEMENTATION  OF STACK\\nInitially,  when  the  stack  is empty,  top  points  to NULL.

An  arithmetic  expression  consists  of  operands  and\\noperators.   The  operands  can  be  numeric  values  or  numeric  variables.\\nThe  operators  used  in an  arithmetic  expression  represent  the  operations\\nlike addition,  subtraction,  multiplication,  division  and  exponentiation.\\nThe  arithmetic  expression  expressed  in its  normal  form  is said  to\\nbe Infix notation,  as shown:\\nA +  B\\nThe above  expression  in prefix form  would  be represented  as follows:\\n+  AB\\nThe same  expression  in postfix form  would  be represented  as follows:\\nAB +  \\nHence  the  given  expression  in infix form  is first  converted  to postfix form\\nand  then  evaluated  to get  the  results.\\nThe  function  to  convert  an  expression  from  infix  to  postfix  consists\\nfollowing  steps:\\n1.Every  character  of the  expression  string  is scanned  in a while  loop\\nuntil the  end  of the  expression  is reached.  \\n2.Following  steps  are  performed  depending  on the  type  of character\\nscanned.  \\n(a)If the  character  scanned  happens  to  be  a  space  then  that\\ncharacter  is skipped.\\n(b)If the  character  scanned  is a digit  or an alphabet,  it is added\\nto the  target  string  pointed  to by t.\\n(c)If the  character  scanned  is a closing  parenthesis  then  it is\\nadded  to the  stack  by calling  push(  ) function.\\n(d)If the  character  scanned  happens  to  be  an  operator,  then\\nfirstly,  the  topmost  element  from  the  stack  is  retrieved.\\nThrough  a while  loop, the  priorities  of the  character  scanned\\n47and  the  character  popped  ‘opr’  are  compared.   Then\\nfollowing  steps  are  performed  as per  the  precedence  rule.\\ni.If ‘opr’  has  higher  or  same  priority  as  the  character\\nscanned,  then  opr is added  to the  target  string.\\nii.If  opr  has  lower  precedence  than  the  character\\nscanned,  then  the  loop  is terminated.   Opr  is pushed\\nback  to the  stack.   Then,  the  character  scanned  is also\\nadded  to the  stack.\\n(e)If  the  character  scanned  happens  to  be  an  opening\\nparenthesis,  then  the  operators  present  in  the  stack  are\\nretrieved  through  a loop.   The  loop  continues  till it does  not\\nencounter  a closing  parenthesis.   The  operators  popped,  are\\nadded  to the  target  string  pointed  to by t.\\n2.Now  the  string  pointed  by t is the  required  postfix expression.  \\nProgram:\\n// Program  to convert  an Infix form  to Postfix form\\n#include  <iostream.h>\\n#include  <string.h>\\n#include  <ctype.h>\\n#include  <conio.h>\\nconst  int MAX=50;\\nclass  infix\\n{\\nprivate:\\nchar  target[MAX], stack[MAX];\\nchar  *s, *t;\\nint top;\\npublic:\\ninfix();\\nvoid push(char  c);\\nchar  pop();\\nvoid convert(char  *str);\\nint priority  (char  c);\\nvoid show();\\n};\\ninfix::infix()\\n{\\ntop=- 1;\\nstrcpy(target,\"\");\\nstrcpy(stack,\"\");\\nt=target;\\ns=\"\";\\n48}\\nvoid infix::push(char  c)\\n{\\nif (top==MAX-1)\\ncout<<\"\\\\nStack  is full\\\\n!\";\\nelse\\n{\\ntop++;\\nstack[top]=c;\\n}\\n}\\nchar  infix::pop()\\n{\\nif (top==- 1)\\n{\\ncout<<\"\\\\nStack  is empty\\\\n\";\\nreturn  -1;\\n}\\nelse\\n{\\nchar  item=stack[top];\\ntop--;\\nreturn  item;\\n}\\n}\\nvoid infix::convert(char  *str)\\n{\\ns=str;\\nwhile(*s!=\\'\\\\0\\')\\n{\\nif (*s==\\'  \\'||*s==\\'\\\\t\\')\\n{\\ns++;\\ncontinue;\\n}\\nif (isdigit(*s) || isalpha(*s))\\n{\\nwhile(isdigit(*s) || isalpha(*s))\\n{\\n*t=*s;\\ns++;\\nt++;\\n}\\n}\\nif (*s==\\'(\\')\\n{\\npush(*s);\\ns++;\\n49}\\nchar  opr;\\nif (*s==\\'*\\'||*s==\\'+\\'||*s==\\'/\\'||*s==\\'%\\'||*s==\\'- \\'||*s==\\'^\\')\\n{\\nif (top!=- 1)\\n{\\nopr=pop();\\nwhile (priority(opr)>=priority(*s))\\n{\\n*t=opr;\\nt++;\\nopr=pop();\\n}\\npush(opr);\\npush(*s);\\n}\\nelse\\npush  (*s);\\ns++;\\n}\\nif (*s==\\')\\')\\n{\\nopr=pop();\\nwhile ((opr)!=\\'(\\')\\n{\\n*t=opr;\\nt++;\\nopr=pop();\\n}\\ns++;\\n}\\n}\\nwhile (top!=- 1)\\n{\\nchar  opr=pop();\\n*t=opr;\\nt++;\\n}\\n*t=\\'\\\\0\\';\\n}\\nint infix::priority(char  c)\\n{\\nif (c==\\'^\\')\\nreturn  3;\\nif (c==\\'*\\'||c==\\'/\\'||c==\\'%\\')\\nreturn  2;\\n50else\\n{\\nif (c==\\'+\\'||c==\\'- \\')\\nreturn  1;\\nelse\\nreturn  0;\\n}\\n}\\nvoid infix::show()\\n{\\n    cout<<target;\\n}\\nvoid main()\\n{\\nclrscr();\\nchar  expr[MAX], *res[MAX];\\ninfix q;\\ncout<<\"\\\\nEnter  an expression  in infix form: \";\\ncin>>expr;\\nq.convert(expr);\\ncout<<\"\\\\nThe  postfix expression  is: \";\\nq.show();\\ngetch();\\n}\\nOutput:\\nEnter  an expression  in infix form: 5^2- 5\\nStack  is empty\\nThe postfix expression  is: 52^5-  \\nEvaluation  of Expression  entered  in postfix  form\\nThe  program  takes  the  input  expression  in  postfix  form.

The\\nend  at which  the  deletion  of an element  take  place  is called  front,  and\\nthe  end  at  which  insertion  of a new  element  can  take  place  is called\\nrear.   The  deletion  or insertion  of elements  can  take  place  only  at the\\nfront  or rear end  of the  list respectively.\\nThe  first  element  that  gets  added  into  the  queue  is the  first  one  to\\nget  removed  from  the  list.   Hence,  queue  is also  referred  to as  First-In-\\nFirst-Out  list  (FIFO).   Queues  can  be  represented  using  both  arrays  as\\nwell as linked  lists.  \\nARRAY IMPLEMENTATION  OF QUEUE\\nIf queue  is implemented  using  arrays,  the  size  of the  array  should\\nbe fixed maximum  allowing  the  queue  to expand  or shrink.    \\nOperations  on  a Queue\\nThere  are  two  common  operations  one  in  a  queue.   They  are\\naddition  of an element  to the  queue  and  deletion  of an element  from  the\\nqueue.   Two variables  front  and  rear  are  used  to point  to the  ends  of the\\nqueue.   The  front  points  to  the  front  end  of the  queue  where  deletion\\ntakes  place  and  rear  points  to  the  rear  end  of the  queue,  where  the\\n54addition  of elements  takes  place.   Initially,  when  the  queue  is full, the\\nfront  and  rear  is equal  to -1.\\nAdd(x)\\nAn element  can  be  added  to the  queue  only at  the  rear  end  of the\\nqueue.   Before  adding  an  element  in the  queue,  it is checked  whether\\nqueue  is  full.   If the  queue  is  full,  then  addition  cannot  take  place.\\nOtherwise,  the  element  is added  to the  end  of the  list at the  rear  side.\\nADDQ(x)\\nIf rear  =  MAX – 1\\nThen\\nPrint  “Queue  is full”\\nReturn\\nElse\\nRear  =  rear  +  1\\nA[rear]  =  x\\nIf front  =  -1\\nThen\\nFront  =  0\\nEnd if\\nEnd if\\nEnd ADDQ( )\\nDel(  )\\nThe  del(  ) operation  deletes  the  element  from  the  front  of  the\\nqueue.

One  way  to think  about  linked  lists  is to look  at  how  arrays  work\\nand  think  about  alternate  approaches.\\nArray is the most common data structure used to store collections of elements. Arrays are convenient\\nto declare and provide the easy syntax to access any element by its index number. Once the array is\\nset up, access to any element is convenient and fast. \\nThe  disadvantages  of arrays  are:\\n\\uf0b7The size  of the  array  is fixed.  Most  often  this  size  is specified  at\\ncompile  time.  This  makes  the  programmers  to  allocate  arrays,\\nwhich  seems  \"large  enough\"  than  required.  \\n\\uf0b7Inserting  new  elements  at  the  front  is  potentially  expensive\\nbecause  existing  elements  need  to  be  shifted  over  to  make\\nroom.\\n\\uf0b7Deleting  an element  from  an array  is not possible.\\nLinked lists have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they happen to be strong where arrays are\\nweak. Generally array\\'s allocates the memory for all its elements in one block whereas linked lists use\\nan entirely different strategy.\\nLinked  lists allocate  memory  for each  element  separately  and  only when  \\nnecessary.\\nHere  is a quick review  of the  terminology  and  rules  of pointers.  The \\nlinked  list code  will depend  on the  following  functions:\\nmalloc() is a system  function  which  allocates  a block  of memory  in the\\n\"heap\"  and  returns  a pointer  to the  new  block.  The prototype  of malloc()\\nand  other  heap  functions  are  in  stdlib.h.   malloc()  returns  NULL  if it\\ncannot  fulfill the  request.  It is defined  by: \\nvoid *malloc (number_of_bytes)  \\nSince a void * is returned the C standard states that this pointer can be converted to any type.  For \\nexample,\\nchar *cp;\\ncp = (char *) malloc (100);\\nAttempts to get 100 bytes and assigns the starting  address to cp. We can also use the sizeof() \\nfunction to specify the number of bytes. For example, \\nint *ip;\\nip = (int *) malloc (100*sizeof(int));\\n59free() is the opposite of malloc(), which de-allocates memory. The argument to free() is a pointer to a\\nblock of memory in the heap — a pointer which  was obtained by a malloc() function. The syntax is:\\nfree (ptr);\\nThe advantage of free() is simply memory management when we no longer need a block.\\n6.1.Linked  List:\\n \\nA linked list is a non-sequential collection of data items. It is a dynamic data structure. For every data\\nitem in a linked list, there is an associated pointer that would give the memory location of the next\\ndata item in the linked list.\\nThe data items in the linked list are not in consecutive memory locations. They may be anywhere, but\\nthe accessing of these data items is easier as each data item contains the address of the next data\\nitem.\\nAdvantages  of linked  lists:\\nLinked  lists  have  many  advantages.  Some  of  the  very  important\\nadvantages  are:\\n1.Linked  lists  are  dynamic  data  structures.  i.e., they  can  grow  or\\nshrink  during  the  execution  of a program.\\n2.Linked  lists  have  efficient  memory  utilization.  Here,  memory  is\\nnot  pre-allocated.  Memory  is allocated  whenever  it is required\\nand  it is de-allocated  (removed)  when  it is no longer  needed.\\n3.Insertion  and  Deletions  are  easier  and  efficient.  Linked  lists\\nprovide  flexibility in inserting  a data  item  at a specified  position\\nand  deletion  of the  data  item  from  the  given  position.  \\n4.Many  complex  applications  can  be easily carried  out  with  linked\\nlists.\\nDisadvantages  of linked  lists:\\n1.It  consumes  more  space  because  every  node  requires  a\\nadditional  pointer  to store  address  of the  next  node.\\n2.Searching  a particular  element  in list  is difficult  and  also  time\\nconsuming.  \\nTypes  of Linked  Lists:\\nBasically we can  put  linked  lists into the  following  four items:\\n1.Single  Linked  List.\\n2.Double  Linked  List.\\n603.Circular  Linked  List.\\n4.Circular  Double  Linked  List.\\nA single  linked  list is one  in which  all nodes  are  linked  together  in some\\nsequential  manner.  Hence,  it is also called  as linear  linked  list. \\nA double  linked  list  is  one  in  which  all  nodes  are  linked  together  by\\nmultiple  links  which  helps  in accessing  both  the  successor  node  (next\\nnode)  and  predecessor  node  (previous  node)  from  any  arbitrary  node\\nwithin  the  list.  Therefore  each  node  in a double  linked  list  has  two  link\\nfields  (pointers)  to point  to the  left  node  (previous)  and  the  right  node\\n(next).  This  helps  to  traverse  in  forward  direction  and  backward\\ndirection.\\nA circular  linked  list is one, which  has  no beginning  and  no end.  A single\\nlinked  list can  be made  a circular  linked  list by simply storing  address  of\\nthe  very first  node  in the  link field of the  last node.\\nA circular  double  linked  list is one,  which  has  both  the  successor  pointer\\nand  predecessor  pointer  in the  circular  manner.\\nComparison  between  array  and  linked  list:\\nARRAY LINKED  LIST\\nSize of an array  is fixed Size of a list is not fixed\\nMemory  is allocated  from  stack Memory  is allocated  from  heap\\nIt  is  necessary  to  specify  the\\nnumber  of  elements  during\\ndeclaration  (i.e.,  during  compile\\ntime).It is not  necessary  to specify  the\\nnumber  of  elements  during\\ndeclaration  (i.e.,  memory  is\\nallocated  during  run  time).\\nIt  occupies  less  memory  than  a\\nlinked  list  for  the  same  number\\nof elements.It occupies  more  memory.\\nInserting  new  elements  at  the\\nfront  is  potentially  expensive\\nbecause  existing  elements  need\\nto be shifted  over  to make  room.Inserting  a  new  element  at  any\\nposition  can  be carried  out easily.\\nDeleting  an  element  from  an\\narray  is not possible.Deleting  an element  is possible.\\nApplications  of linked  list:\\n1.Linked  lists  are  used  to  represent  and  manipulate  polynomial.\\nPolynomials  are  expression  containing  terms  with  non  zero\\ncoefficient  and  exponents.  For example:   \\nP(x) =  a0 Xn +  a1 Xn-1 +  …… +  an-1 X +  an\\n612.Represent  very large  numbers  and  operations  of the  large  number  \\nsuch  as addition,  multiplication  and  division.\\n3.Linked  lists are  to implement  stack,  queue,  trees  and  graphs.\\n4.Implement  the  symbol table  in compiler  construction\\n6.2.Single  Linked  List:\\nA linked list allocates space for each element separately in its own block of memory called a \"node\".\\nThe list gets an overall structure by using pointers to connect all its nodes together like the links in a\\nchain.\\nEach  node  contains  two fields; a \"data\"  field to store  whatever  element,  \\nand  a \"next\" field which  is a pointer  used  to link to the  next  node.\\nEach  node  is allocated  in the  heap  using   malloc(),  so the  node  memory\\ncontinues  to exist  until it is explicitly de-allocated  using   free(). The front\\nof the  list is a pointer  to the  “start”  node.  A single  linked  list is shown  in\\nfigure  6.2.1.\\n100 \\n10    200 20    300   30    400 40     X \\n100 200 300 400 sta rt \\nFigure 6.2.1. Single Linked List   HEAP STACK \\nThe next field of the last node is NULL. The st art  point er holds t he  address of the first  node of t he list. Each node st ores t he dat a. Stores t he next  node address. \\nThe beginning  of the  linked  list is stored  in a \" start\" pointer  which  points\\nto the  first  node.  The  first  node  contains  a pointer  to the  second  node.\\nThe  second  node  contains  a pointer  to the  third  node,  ... and  so on. The\\nlast  node  in the  list has  its next  field set  to NULL to mark  the  end  of the\\nlist.  Code  can  access  any  node  in the  list  by starting  at  the  start and\\nfollowing  the  next  pointers.  \\nThe  start pointer  is an  ordinary  local  pointer  variable,  so  it is drawn\\nseparately  on the  left  top  to show  that  it is in the  stack.  The  list  nodes\\nare  drawn  on the  right  to show  that  they are  allocated  in the  heap.\\nImplementation  of Single  Linked  List:\\n62Before  writing  the  code  to build  the  above  list, we need  to create  a start\\nnode,  used  to  create  and  access  other  nodes  in  the  linked  list.  The\\nfollowing  structure  definition  will do (see  figure  6.2.2):\\n\\uf0b7Creating  a  structure  with  one  data  item  and  a  next  pointer,\\nwhich  will be  pointing  to next  node  of the  list.

This helps in accessing\\nboth successor node and predecessor node from the given node position. It provides bi-directional\\ntraversing. Each node contains three fields: \\n\\uf0b7Left link. \\n\\uf0b7Data.  \\n\\uf0b7Right  link. \\nThe left link points  to the  predecessor  node  and  the  right  link points  to \\nthe  successor  node.  The data  field stores  the  required  data.  \\nMany  applications  require  searching  forward  and  backward  thru  nodes  \\nof a list. For example  searching  for a name  in a telephone  directory  \\n75would  need  forward  and  backward  scanning  thru  a region  of the  whole  \\nlist.\\nThe basic  operations  in a double  linked  list are:\\n\\uf0b7Creation.\\n\\uf0b7Insertion.\\n\\uf0b7Deletion.\\n\\uf0b7Traversing.\\nA double  linked  list is shown  in figure  6.3.1.\\n100 \\n X     10    200  200    30     X \\n100 200 300 sta rt \\nFigure 6.3.1.

The nodes \\nr1, r2,..., rn are called the children of r.\\nIn a tree data structure, there is no distinction between the various children of a node i.e., none is the \\n\"first child\" or \"last child\". A tree in which such distinctions are made is called an ordered tree, and \\ndata structures built on them are called ordered tree data structures . Ordered trees are by far the \\ncommonest form of tree data structure. \\nA special kind of tree called binary tree is easy to maintain in the computer.\\n7.2.BINARY TREE:\\nA binary tree is a tree in which each node can have at most two children. \\nA binary tree is either empty or consists of a node called the root together with two binary trees \\ncalled the left subtree and the right subtree. \\nA tree with no nodes is called as a null tree. A binary tree is shown in figure 7. 2.\\n114A \\nC B \\nF E G D \\nI H \\nFigure 7.2.1. Binary Tree  right child left child \\nright subtree \\nleft subtree \\n \\n \\nTree Terminology:\\nLeaf node:\\nA node with no children is called a leaf (or external node).  A node which is not a leaf is called\\nan internal node.\\nPath \\nA sequence of nodes n1, n2, . . ., nk, such that ni is the parent of ni + 1 for i = 1, 2,. . ., k - 1. The \\nlength of a path is 1 less than the number of nodes on the path. Thus there is a path of length\\nzero from a node to itself. \\nFor the tree shown in figure 7.2.1, the path between A and I is A, B, D, I.\\nSiblings \\nThe children of the same parent are called siblings. \\nFor the tree shown in figure 7.2.1, F and G are the siblings of the parent node B and H and I \\nare the siblings of the parent node D. \\nAncestor and  Descendent\\n  \\nIf there  is a path  from  node  A to node  B, then  A is called  an \\nancestor  of B and\\nB is called a descendent of A .\\n \\nSubtree \\nAny node  of a tree,  with  all of its descendants  is a subtree.\\nLevel\\nThe level of the node refers to its distance from the root. The root of the tree has level O, and \\nthe level of any other node in the tree is one more than the level of its parent. For example, in\\nthe binary tree of Figure 7.2.1 node F is at level 2 and node H is at level 3. \\nThe maximum number of nodes at any level is 2 n. \\nHeight \\nThe maximum level in a tree determines its height. The height of a node in a tree is the length\\nof a longest path from the node to a leaf. The term depth is also used to denote height of the \\ntree. The height of the tree of Figure 7.2.1 is 3. \\nAssigning level numbers and Numbering of nodes for a binary tree:\\nThe nodes of a binary tree can be numbered in a natural way, level by level, left to right. The \\nnodes of an complete binary tree can be numbered so that the root is assigned the number 1,\\n115a left child is assigned twice the number assigned its parent, and a right child is assigned one\\nmore than twice the number assigned its parent. For example, see Figure 7.2.2. \\n1 \\n3 2 \\n6 5 7 4 \\n9 8 \\nFigure 7.2.2. Level by level numbering of binary tree  Level 0 \\nLevel 1 \\nLevel 2 \\nLevel 3 \\nProperties of binary trees:\\nSome of the important properties of a binary tree are as follows:\\n1.If h = height of a binary tree, then\\na.Maximum number of leaves = 2 h\\nb.Maximum number of nodes =  2h + 1 - 1\\n2.If a binary tree  contains m nodes at level l, it contains at most 2m nodes at level l + 1. \\n3.Since a binary tree can contain at most one node at level 0 (the root), it can contain at most 2 l\\nnode at level l. \\n4.The total number of edges in a full binary tree with n node is n - 1.\\nStrictly Binary tree:\\nIf every non-leaf node in a binary tree has nonempty left and right subtrees, the tree is termed\\na strictly binary tree. Thus the tree of figure 7.2.3(a) is strictly binary. A strictly binary tree with\\nn leaves always contains 2n - 1 nodes. \\nFull Binary tree:\\nA full binary tree of height h has all its leaves at level h. Alternatively; All non leaf nodes of a full\\nbinary tree have two children, and the leaf nodes have no children.\\nA full binary tree with height h has 2h + 1 - 1 nodes. A full binary tree of height h is a strictly \\nbinary tree all of whose leaves are at level h. Figure 7.2.3(d) illustrates the full binary tree \\ncontaining 15 nodes and of height 3.\\nA full binary tree of height h contains 2 h leaves and, 2h - 1 non-leaf nodes. \\nThus by induction, total number of nodes ( 122)1\\n0\\uf02d\\uf03d\\uf0e5\\uf03d\\uf02b\\n\\uf03dhh\\nlltn .\\nFor example, a full binary tree of height 3 contains 2 3+1 – 1 = 15 nodes.\\n1161 \\n1 8 1 \\n12 6 2 \\n2 2 3 \\n7 \\n13 3 \\n3 4 5 \\n5 4 6 7 \\nFigure 7.2.3.

Figure 7.2.4 shows examples of complete and incomplete binary \\ntrees.\\nA complete  binary  tree  of height  h looks like a full binary  tree  down\\nto level h-1, and  the  level h is filled from  left to right.\\nA complete binary tree with n leaves that is not strictly binary has 2n nodes. For example, the \\ntree of Figure 7.2.3(c) is a complete binary tree having 5 leaves and 10 nodes. \\n1 \\n3 \\n6 1 \\n2 \\n4 2 \\n5 4 2 3 \\n5 4 7 \\nFigure 7.2.4.

It may be empty. If it is not empty then it satisfies the following \\nproperties:\\n1.Every element has a key and no two elements have the same key.\\n2.The keys in the left subtree are smaller than the key in the root.\\n3.The keys in the right subtree are larger than the key in the root.\\n1174.The left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.\\nFigure 7.2.5(a) is a binary search tree, whereas figure 7.2.5(b) is not a binary search tree.\\n16 \\n20 \\n19 12 \\n11 12 \\n14 \\n13 13 20 \\n14 11 \\n17 \\nFigure 7.2.5.

Arrays; especially suited for complete and full binary trees. \\n2.Pointer-based. \\nArray-based Implementation:\\nBinary trees can also be stored in arrays, and if the tree is a complete binary tree, this method wastes\\nno space. In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index i, its children are found at indices 2 i+1 \\nand 2i+2, while its parent (if any) is found at index floor((i-1)/2) (assuming the root of the tree stored in\\nthe array at an index zero). \\nThis method benefits from more compact storage and better locality of reference, particularly during a\\npreorder traversal. However, it requires contiguous memory, expensive to grow and wastes space \\nproportional to 2h - n for a tree of height h with n nodes. \\n   0       1       2       3       4      5       6  \\nLinked  Representation  (Pointer  based):\\nArray representation is good for complete binary tree, but it is wasteful for many other binary trees. \\nThe representation suffers from insertion and deletion of node from the middle of the tree, as it \\nrequires the moment of potentially many nodes to reflect the change in level number of this node. To \\novercome this difficulty we represent the binary tree in linked representation.\\nIn linked  representation  each  node  in a binary  has  three  fields,  the  left\\nchild  field denoted  as  LeftChild, data  field denoted  as  data and  the  right\\nchild  field  denoted  as  RightChild. If any  sub-tree  is  empty  then  the\\ncorresponding  pointer’s  LeftChild  and  RightChild  will  store  a  NULL\\nvalue.  If the  tree  itself is empty  the  root  pointer  will store  a NULL value.  \\nThe advantage  of using  linked  representation  of binary  tree  is that:\\n118\\uf0b7Insertion  and  deletion  involve  no  data  movement  and  no\\nmovement  of nodes  except  the  rearrangement  of pointers.\\nThe disadvantages  of linked  representation  of binary  tree  includes:\\n\\uf0b7Given  a  node  structure,  it is difficult  to  determine  its  parent\\nnode.\\n\\uf0b7Memory  spaces  are  wasted  for  storing  NULL  pointers  for  the\\nnodes,  which  have  no subtrees.\\nThe structure  definition,  node  representation  empty  binary  tree  is shown\\nin figure  7.2.6  and  the  linked  representation  of binary  tree  using  this\\nnode  structure  is given  in figure  7.2.7.  \\n NULL root \\nFigure 7.2.6.

Search  involves  visiting  nodes  in a  graph  in a\\nsystematic  manner,  and  may  or  may  not  result  into  a visit  to all nodes.\\n119When  the  search  necessarily  involved  the  examination  of every  vertex  in\\nthe  tree,  it is called  the  traversal.\\nThere  are  four common  ways  to traverse  a binary  tree:\\n1.Preorder\\n2.Inorder   \\n3.Postorder\\n4.Level order\\nIn  the  first  three  traversal  methods,  the  left  subtree  of  a  node  is\\ntraversed  before  the  right  subtree.  The  difference  among  them  comes\\nfrom  the  difference  in the  time  at which  a root  node  is visited.  \\nInorder  Traversal:\\nIn the case of inorder traversal, the root of each subtree is visited after its left subtree has been \\ntraversed but before the traversal of its right subtree begins. The steps for traversing a binary tree in \\ninorder traversal are:\\n1.Visit the  left subtree,  using  inorder.\\n2.Visit the  root.\\n3.Visit the  right  subtree,  using  inorder.\\nThe algorithm  for inorder  traversal  is as follows:\\nvoid inorder(node  *root)\\n{\\nif(root  !=  NULL)\\n{\\ninorder(root- >lchild);\\nprint  root  ->  data;\\ninorder(root- >rchild);\\n}\\n}\\nPreorder  Traversal:\\nIn a preorder traversal, each root node is visited before its left and right subtrees are traversed. \\nPreorder search is also called backtracking. The steps for traversing a binary tree in preorder \\ntraversal are:\\n1.Visit the  root.\\n2.Visit the  left subtree,  using  preorder.\\n3.Visit the  right  subtree,  using  preorder.\\nThe algorithm  for preorder  traversal  is as follows:\\nvoid preorder(node  *root)\\n{\\nif( root  !=  NULL )\\n{\\n120print root -> data;\\npreorder  (root  ->  lchild);\\npreorder  (root  ->  rchild);\\n}\\n}\\nPostorder  Traversal:\\nIn a postorder  traversal,  each  root  is visited  after  its left and  right  \\nsubtrees  have  been  traversed.  The steps  for traversing  a binary  tree  in \\npostorder  traversal  are:\\n1.Visit the  left subtree,  using  postorder.\\n2.Visit the  right  subtree,  using  postorder\\n3.Visit the  root.\\nThe algorithm  for postorder  traversal  is as follows:\\nvoid postorder(node  *root)\\n{\\nif( root  !=  NULL )\\n{\\npostorder  (root  ->  lchild);\\npostorder  (root  ->  rchild);\\nprint  (root  ->  data);\\n}\\n}\\nLevel  order  Traversal:\\nIn a level order traversal elements are visited by level from top to bottom. Within levels, elements are \\nvisited from left to right. The level order traversal requires a queue data structure. So, it is not possible\\nto develop a recursive procedure to traverse the binary tree in level order. This is nothing but a \\nbreadth first search technique.\\nThe algorithm  for level order  traversal  is as follows:\\nvoid levelorder()\\n{\\nint j;\\nfor(j =  0; j <  ctr; j++)\\n{\\nif(tree[j] !=  NULL)\\nprint tree[j] -> data;\\n}\\n}\\n121Example  1:\\nTraverse the following binary tree in pre, post, inorder and level order.\\nA \\nB \\nD C \\nE F \\nG H I \\x00Preorder traversal yields:  \\n     A, B, D, C, E, G, F, H, I  \\n \\n\\x00Postorder traversal yields:  \\n     D, B, G, E, H, I, F, C, A  \\n \\n\\x00Inorder traversal yields: \\n     D, B, A, E, G, C, H, F, I  \\n \\n\\x00Level order traversal yields:  \\n      A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I  \\nBinary Tree  Pre, Post, Inorder and level order Traversing  \\nExample  2:\\nTraverse the following binary tree in pre, post, inorder and level order.\\nP \\nF \\nH B Y \\nG R S \\x00Preorder traversal yields:  \\n     P, F, B, H, G, S, R, Y, T, W, Z  \\n \\n\\x00Postorder traversal yields:  \\n     B, G, H, F, R, W, T, Z, Y, S,  P  \\n \\n\\x00Inorder traversal yields:  \\n    B, F, G, H, P, R, S, T, W, Y, Z  \\n \\n\\x00Level order traversal yields:  \\n     P, F, S, B, H, R, Y, G, T, Z, W  \\nBinary Tree  Pre, Post, Inorder and level order Traversing  Z T \\nW \\nExample  3:\\nTraverse the following binary tree in pre, post, inorder and level order.\\n2 \\n7 \\n6 2 9 \\n5 5 \\x00Preorder traversal yields:  \\n     2, 7, 2, 6, 5, 11, 5, 9, 4  \\n \\n\\x00Postorder travarsal yields:  \\n     2, 5, 11, 6, 7, 4, 9, 5, 2  \\n \\n\\x00Inorder travarsal yields:  \\n     2, 7, 5, 6, 11, 2, 5, 4, 9  \\n \\n\\x00Level order traversal yields:  \\n     2, 7, 5, 2, 6, 9, 5, 11, 4 \\nBinary Tree  Pre, Post, Inorder and level order Trav ersing  4 11 \\nExample  4:\\nTraverse the following binary tree in pre, post, inorder and level order.\\n122A \\nB \\nK L E \\nG C \\x00Preorder traversal yields:  \\n     A, B, D, G, K, H, L, M, C, E  \\n \\n\\x00Postorder travarsal yields:  \\n     K, G, L, M, H, D, B, E, C, A  \\n \\n\\x00Inorder travarsal yields:  \\n     K, G, D, L, H, M, B, A, E, C  \\n \\n\\x00Level order traversal yields:  \\n      A, B, C, D, E, G, H, K, L, M  \\nBinary Tree  Pre, Post, Inorder and level order Trav ersing  D \\nH \\nM \\nFormation  of Binary  Tree  from  its  Traversal:\\nSometimes  it is required  to construct  a binary  tree  if its traversals  are  \\nknown.  From  a single  traversal  it is not possible  to construct  unique  \\nbinary  tree.  However  if two are  traversals  then  corresponding  tree  can  \\nbe drawn  uniquely. The basic  principle  for formulation  is as follows:\\nIf the  preorder  traversal  is given,  then  the  first  node  is the  root  node.  If\\nthe  postorder  traversal  is given  then  the  last  node  is the  root  node.  Once\\nthe  root  node  is identified,  all the  nodes  in the  left  sub-trees  and  right\\nsub-trees  of the  root  node  can  be identified.  \\nSame  technique  can  be applied  repeatedly  to form  sub-trees.  \\nIt  can  be  noted  that,  for  the  purpose  mentioned,  two  traversal  are\\nessential  out  of  which  one  should  be  inorder  traversal  and  another\\npreorder  or  postorder;  alternatively,  given  preorder  and  postorder\\ntraversals,  binary  tree  cannot  be obtained  uniquely. \\nExample  1:\\nConstruct  a binary  tree  from  a given  preorder  and

It is also possible for a node\\nto have only one child, as is the case with the unary minus operator. The leaves of an expression tree\\nare operands, such as constants or variable names, and the other (non leaf) nodes contain operators.\\nOnce an expression tree is constructed we can traverse it in three ways:\\n\\uf0b7Inorder Traversal\\n\\uf0b7Preorder Traversal\\n\\uf0b7Postorder Traversal\\nFigure 7.4.1 shows some more expression trees that represent arithmetic expressions given in infix \\nform.\\n/ \\nb + \\nc a + \\nd + + \\nc + d \\nb a \\n- + * / \\n+ + \\nx a * \\ny a c b (a)  ( a + b) + (c / d)  \\n(c)  ((-a) + ( x + y)) / (( +b) *  (c *  a))  (b)  (( a + b) + c) + d  \\nFigure 7.4.1  Expression Trees  \\nAn expression tree can be generated for the infix and postfix expressions.\\nAn algorithm to convert a postfix expression into an expression tree is as follows:\\n1.Read the expression one symbol at a time. \\n2.If the symbol is an operand, we create a one-node tree and push a pointer to it onto a\\nstack. \\n3.If the symbol is an operator, we pop pointers to two trees T1 and T2 from the stack (T1 is\\npopped first) and form a new tree whose root is the operator and whose left and right\\nchildren point to T2 and T1 respectively. A pointer to this new tree is then pushed onto\\nthe stack.\\nExample 1:\\nConstruct an expression tree for the postfix expression: a b + c d e + * * \\nThe first two symbols are operands, so we create one-node trees and push pointers to them onto a \\nstack.\\n151a b \\nNext, a ‘+’ is read, so two pointers to trees are popped, a new tree is formed, and a pointer to it is \\npushed onto the stack. \\na b + \\nb \\nNext, c, d, and e are read, and for each one–node tree is created and a pointer to the corresponding \\ntree is pushed onto the stack.\\na b + \\nb c d e \\nNow a ‘+’ is read, so two trees are merged. \\na b + \\nb c \\nd e + + \\nContinuing, a ‘*’ is read, so we pop two tree pointers and form a new tree with a ‘*’ as root.\\na + \\nb c \\nd e + \\n+ \\ne * \\nFinally, the last symbol is read, two trees are merged, and a pointer to the final tree is left on the \\nstack. \\n152a + \\nb c \\nd e + \\n+ \\ne * * \\nFor the above tree:\\nInorder  form  of the  expression:  a +  b * c * d +  e\\nPreorder  form  of the  expression:  * +  a b * c +  d e\\nPostorder  form  of the  expression:  a b +  c d e +  * *\\nExample 2:\\nConstruct an expression tree for the arithmetic expression:\\n(A + B * C) – ((D * E + F) / G)\\nSolution:\\nFirst convert the infix expression into postfix notation.\\nPostfix notation of the arithmetic expression is:  A B C * + D E * F + G / - \\nThe first three symbols are operands, so we create one-node trees and pointers to three nodes \\npushed onto the stack.\\nA B C \\nNext, a ‘*’ is read, so two pointers to trees are popped, a new tree is formed, and a pointer to it is \\npushed onto the stack. \\nB A * \\nC \\nNext, a ‘+’ is read, so two pointers to trees are popped, a new tree is formed, and a pointer to it is \\npushed onto the stack.\\n153B A * \\nC + \\nNext, D and E are read, and for each one–node tree is created and a pointer to the corresponding \\ntree is pushed onto the stack.\\nB A * \\nC + E D \\nContinuing, a ‘*’ is read, so we pop two tree pointers and form a new tree with a ‘*’ as root.\\nA \\nB C D + \\n* E * \\nProceeding similar to the previous steps, finally, when the last symbol is read, the expression tree is \\nas follows: \\n154A + \\nB * G \\nC + / \\n* - \\n+ \\nF \\nD E \\n       UNIT-5             GRAPHS\\nGraph G is a pair (V, E), where V is a finite set of vertices and E is a finite set of edges. We will often\\ndenote n = |V|, e = |E|.\\nA graph  is generally  displayed  as  figure  7.5.1,  in which  the  vertices  are\\nrepresented  by circles  and  the  edges  by lines. \\nAn edge  with  an  orientation  (i.e.,  arrow  head)  is a directed  edge,  while\\nan edge  with no orientation  is our undirected  edge.  \\nIf  all  the  edges  in  a  graph  are  undirected,  then  the  graph  is  an\\nundirected  graph.  The  graph  of figures  7.5.1(a)  is undirected  graphs.  If\\nall the  edges  are  directed;  then  the  graph  is a directed  graph.  The graph\\nof figure  7.5.1(b)  is a directed  graph.  A directed  graph  is also  called  as\\ndigraph.  \\nA graph  G is connected  if and  only if there  is a simple  path  between  any\\ntwo nodes  in G. \\nA graph  G is said  to be complete  if every  node  a in G is adjacent  to every\\nother  node  v in G. A complete  graph  with  n  nodes  will  have  n(n-1)/2\\nedges.  For  example,  Figure  7.5.1.(a)  and  figure  7.5.1.(d)  are  complete\\ngraphs.\\n155A directed  graph  G is said  to be connected,  or strongly  connected,  if for\\neach  pair  u, v for nodes  in G there  is a path  from  u to v and  there  is a\\npath  from  v  to  u.  On  the  other  hand,  G  is  said  to  be  unilaterally\\nconnected  if for any pair  u, v of nodes  in G there  is a path  from  u to v or\\na path  from  v to u. For  example,  the  digraph  shown  in figure  7.5.1  (e) is\\nstrongly  connected.\\nA B \\nC D E B D \\nG E C \\nF A \\nFigure 7.5.1 Various Graphs  (b) (a)  v4   v2  \\n v3   v1  \\n(d)  v4   v2  \\n v3   v1  (c) \\n(f)  v4   v2  \\n v3   v1  v1 \\nv2 v3 \\nv4 v5 v6 v7 (g) (e)  v4   v2  \\n v3   v1  \\nWe can assign weight function to the edges: w G (e) is a weight of edge e \\uf0ce E. The graph which has\\nsuch function assigned is called weighted graph.\\nThe number of incoming edges to a vertex v is called in–degree of the vertex (denote indeg(v)). The\\nnumber of outgoing edges from a vertex is called out-degree (denote outdeg(v)). For example, let us\\nconsider the digraph shown in figure 7.5.1(f),\\nindegree(v1) = 2outdegree(v1) = 1\\nindegree(v2) = 2outdegree(v2) = 0\\nA path is a sequence of vertices (v 1, v2, . . . . . . , vk), where for all i, (vi, vi+1) \\uf065 E. A path is simple if all\\nvertices in the path are distinct. If there a path containing one or more edges which starts from a\\nvertex Vi and terminates into the same vertex then the path is known as a cycle. For example, there is\\na cycle in figure 7.5.1 (a), figure 7.5.1 (c) and figure 7.5.1 (d). \\nIf a graph (digraph) does not have any cycle then it is called acyclic graph. For example, the graphs\\nof figure 7.5.1 (f) and figure 7.5.1 (g) are acyclic graphs.\\nA graph G’ = (V’, E’) is a sub-graph of graph G = (V, E) iff V’ \\uf0cd V and E’ \\uf0cd E.\\nA Forest is a set of disjoint trees. If we remove the root node of a given tree then it becomes forest.\\nThe following figure shows a forest F that consists of three trees T1, T2 and T3. \\n156A graph that has either self loop or parallel edges or both is called multi-graph. \\nTree is a connected acyclic graph  (there aren’t any sequences of edges that go around in a loop). A\\nspanning tree of a graph G = (V, E) is a tree that contains all vertices of V and is a subgraph of G. A\\nsingle graph can have multiple spanning trees. \\nLet T be a spanning tree of a graph G. Then \\n1.Any two vertices in T are connected by a unique simple path. \\n2.If any edge is removed from T, then T becomes disconnected. \\n3.If we add any edge into T, then the new graph will contain a cycle.\\n4.Number of edges in T is n-1.\\nRepresentation of Graphs:\\nThere are two ways of representing digraphs. They are:\\n\\uf0b7Adjacency matrix.\\n\\uf0b7Adjacency List.\\n\\uf0b7Incidence matrix.\\nAdjacency matrix:\\nIn this representation, the adjacency matrix of a graph G is a two dimensional n x n matrix, say A =\\n(ai,j), where\\n\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf03dotherwisevtovfromedgeanisthereifajiji01\\n,\\nThe matrix is symmetric in case of undirected graph, while it may be asymmetric if the graph is\\ndirected.

Minimum spanning tree (MST)\\nis a spanning tree with the smallest possible weight. \\nExample: \\nG: \\nA graph G: Three ( of many possible) spanning trees fro m graph G:  \\n5 2 \\n4 \\n6 \\n1 3 \\nA weight ed graph G:  The minimal spanning tree fro m weight ed graph G:  2 \\n3 \\n1 G: \\nLet\\'s consider a couple of real-world examples on minimum spanning tree: \\n\\uf0b7One practical application of a MST would be in the design of a network.  For instance, a\\ngroup of individuals, who are separated by varying distances, wish to be connected\\ntogether in a telephone network.   Although MST cannot do anything about the distance\\nfrom one connection to another, it can be used to determine the least cost paths with no\\ncycles in this network, thereby connecting everyone at a minimum cost.\\n\\uf0b7Another useful application of MST would be finding airline routes.  The vertices of the\\ngraph would represent cities, and the edges would represent routes between the cities.  \\nMST can be applied to optimize airline routes by finding the least costly paths with no\\ncycles. \\nMinimum spanning tree, can be constructed using any of the following two algorithms: abcdefghijkl\\nA100000100000\\nB111000000000\\nC010100110010\\nD001111000000\\nE000010011100\\nF000000000111\\nG000001001001\\n1591.Kruskal’s algorithm and \\n2.Prim algorithm. \\nBoth algorithms differ in their methodology, but both eventually end up with the MST.  Kruskal\\'s \\nalgorithm uses edges, and Prim’s algorithm uses vertex connections in determining the MST. \\n7.6.1.Kruskal’s Algorithm \\nThis is a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm chooses some local optimum (i.e. picking an edge with\\nthe least weight in a MST).\\nKruskal\\'s algorithm works as follows: Take a graph with \\'n\\' vertices, keep on adding the shortest \\n(least cost) edge, while avoiding the creation of cycles, until (n - 1) edges have been added. \\nSometimes two or more edges may have the same cost. \\nThe order in which the edges are chosen, in this case, does not matter. Different MST’s may result, \\nbut they will all have the same total cost, which will always be the minimum cost.  \\nKruskal’s Algorithm for minimal spanning tree is as follows:\\n1.Make  the  tree  T empty.  \\n2.Repeat  the  steps  3, 4 and  5 as  long  as  T contains  less  than  n - 1\\nedges  and  E is not empty  otherwise,  proceed  to step  6.\\n3.Choose  an edge  (v, w) from  E of lowest  cost.\\n4.Delete  (v, w) from  E.\\n5.If (v, w) does  not create  a cycle in T \\nthen Add (v, w) to T\\nelse  discard  (v, w)\\n6.If T contains  fewer  than  n - 1 edges  then  print  no spanning  tree.\\nExample  1:\\nConstruct  the  minimal  spanning  tree  for the  graph  shown  below:\\n \\n 3 \\n5 2 1 \\n6 4 \\n15 50 10 \\n30 \\n20          35 45        40 \\n25 \\n55 \\nArrange  all the  edges  in the  increasing  order  of their costs:\\nCost10152025303540455055\\nEdge(1, 2)(3, 6)(4, 6)(2, 6)(1, 4)(3, 5)(2, 5)(1, 5)(2, 3)(5, 6)\\nThe stages  in Kruskal’s algorithm  for minimal  spanning  tree  is as follows:\\n160EdgeCostStages  in Kruskal’s  algorithm Remarks\\n(1, 2)102 1 \\n3 \\n4 5 \\n6 The  edge  between  vertices  1 and  2 is the\\nfirst  edge  selected.

Reachability  Matrix  (Warshall’s Algorithm) :\\nWarshall’s  algorithm  requires  to know  which  edges  exist  and  which  do\\nnot.  It  doesn’t  need  to  know  the  lengths  of  the  edges  in  the  given\\ndirected  graph.  This  information  is conveniently  displayed  by adjacency\\nmatrix  for  the  graph,  in which  a ‘1’ indicates  the  existence  of an  edge\\nand  ‘0’ indicates  non-existence.  \\nAdjacency Matrix W arshall’s Algorit h m  All Pairs Rec hability  Matrix \\nIt begins  with  the  adjacency  matrix  for the  given  graph,  which  is called\\nA0, and  then  updates  the  matrix  ‘n’ times,  producing  matrices  called  A 1,\\nA2, . . . . . , An and  then  stops.  \\nIn warshall’s   algorithm  the  matrix  A i merely  contains  information  about\\nthe  existence  of i – paths.  A 1 entry  in the  matrix A i will correspond  to the\\nexistence  of an  i – paths  and  O entry  will correspond  to non-existence.\\nThus  when  the  algorithm  stops,  the  final matrix,  the  matrix  A n, contains\\nthe  desired  connectivity  information.  \\nA 1 entry  indicates  a pair  of vertices,  which  are  connected,  and  O entry\\nindicates  a pair, which  are  not. This matrix  is called  a reachability  matrix\\nor path  matrix for the  graph.  It is also called  the  transitive  closure  of the\\noriginal  adjacency  matrix. \\nThe update  rule  for computing  A i from  Ai-1 in warshall’s algorithm  is: \\nAi [x, y] =  Ai-1 [x, y] ۷ (Ai-1 [x, i] ٨ Ai-1 [i, y]) ----        (1)\\nExample  1: \\nUse  warshall’s  algorithm  to  calculate  the  reachability  matrix  for  the\\ngraph:  \\n1633 2 1 4 \\n11 4 \\n7 \\n7 5 \\n1 6 \\nWe begin  with the  adjacency  matrix of the  graph  ‘A 0’\\n\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\n\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\n\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\n\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\n\\uf03d\\n0111000011000110\\n4321\\n0A\\nThe first  step  is to compute  ‘A 1’ matrix.

Traversing  a Graph:\\nMany graph algorithms require one to systematically examine the nodes and edges of a graph G. \\nThere are two standard ways to do this. They are:\\n\\uf0b7Breadth first traversal (BFT)\\n\\uf0b7Depth first traversal (DFT) \\nThe BFT will use a queue as an auxiliary structure to hold nodes for future processing and the DFT \\nwill use a STACK.\\nDuring  the  execution  of these  algorithms,  each  node  N of G will be in one\\nof three  states,  called  the  status  of N, as follows:\\n1.STATUS = 1 (Ready state): The initial state of the node N.\\n2.STATUS  =  2  (Waiting  state):  The  node  N  is  on  the  QUEUE  or\\nSTACK, waiting  to be processed.\\n3.STATUS =  3 (Processed  state):  The node  N has  been  processed.  \\nBoth  BFS and  DFS  impose  a tree  (the  BFS/DFS  tree)  on the  structure  of\\ngraph.  So,  we  can  compute  a spanning  tree  in a graph.  The  computed\\nspanning  tree  is  not  a  minimum  spanning  tree.  The  spanning  trees\\nobtained  using  depth  first  searches  are  called  depth  first  spanning  trees.\\nThe  spanning  trees  obtained  using  breadth  first  searches  are  called\\nBreadth  first spanning  trees.\\nBreadth  first  search  and  traversal:\\nThe  general  idea  behind  a breadth  first  traversal  beginning  at a starting\\nnode  A is as  follows.  First  we  examine  the  starting  node  A. Then  we\\nexamine  all the  neighbors  of A. Then  we  examine  all the  neighbors  of\\nneighbors  of A. And so on. We need  to keep  track  of the  neighbors  of a\\nnode,  and  we  need  to  guarantee  that  no  node  is processed  more  than\\nonce.  This  is accomplished  by  using  a  QUEUE  to  hold  nodes  that  are\\nwaiting  to be  processed,  and  by using  a field  STATUS  that  tells  us  the\\ncurrent  status  of any  node.  The  spanning  trees  obtained  using  BFS  are\\ncalled  Breadth  first  spanning  trees.  \\nBreadth first traversal algorithm on graph G is as follows:\\nThis algorithm executes a BFT on graph G beginning at a starting node A.\\n \\n1.Initialize  all nodes  to the  ready  state  (STATUS =  1).\\n2.Put  the  starting  node  A in QUEUE  and  change  its  status  to  the\\nwaiting  state  (STATUS =  2).\\n1663.Repeat  the  following  steps  until QUEUE  is empty:\\na.Remove  the  front  node  N of QUEUE.  Process  N and  change\\nthe  status  of N to the  processed  state  (STATUS =  3).\\nb.Add to the  rear  of QUEUE  all the  neighbors  of N that  are  in\\nthe  ready  state  (STATUS  =  1), and  change  their  status  to the\\nwaiting  state  (STATUS =  2).\\n4.Exit. \\nDepth  first  search  and  traversal:\\nDepth  first  search  of undirected  graph  proceeds  as  follows:  First  we\\nexamine  the  starting  node  V. Next  an unvisited  vertex  \\'W\\' adjacent  to \\'V\\'\\nis selected  and  a depth  first  search  from  \\'W\\' is initiated.  When  a vertex\\n\\'U\\'  is reached  such  that  all its  adjacent  vertices  have  been  visited,  we\\nback  up  to  the  last  vertex  visited,  which  has  an  unvisited  vertex  \\'W\\'\\nadjacent  to  it  and  initiate  a  depth  first  search  from  W.  The  search\\nterminates  when  no  unvisited  vertex  can  be  reached  from  any  of the\\nvisited  ones.  \\nThis  algorithm  is  similar  to  the  inorder  traversal  of binary  tree.  DFT\\nalgorithm  is  similar  to  BFT  except  now  use  a  STACK  instead  of  the\\nQUEUE.  Again  field  STATUS  is used  to  tell  us  the  current  status  of a\\nnode.  \\nThe algorithm  for depth  first  traversal  on a graph  G is as follows.\\nThis algorithm executes a DFT on graph G beginning at a starting node A.\\n1.

If the  outdegree  of every  node  is exactly\\nequal  to m or zero  then  the  tree  is called  a full or complete  m-ary tree.\\nFor m =  2, the  trees  are  called  binary  and  full binary  trees.  \\nDifferences between trees and binary trees:\\nTREE BINARY TREE\\nEach element in a tree can have any number of \\nsubtrees.Each element in a binary tree has at most two \\nsubtrees.\\nThe subtrees in a tree are unordered.The subtrees of each element in a binary tree \\nare ordered (i.e. we distinguish between left and \\nright subtrees). 7 \\n8 1 \\n3 \\n6 5 2 \\n4 \\nBreadt h First Spanning Tree  \\n171Converting  a m- ary tree  (general  tree)  to a binary  tree:\\nThere  is a one-to-one  mapping  between  general  ordered  trees  and  binary\\ntrees. So,  every  tree  can  be  uniquely  represented  by  a  binary  tree.\\nFurthermore,  a forest  can  also be represented  by a binary  tree.  \\nConversion  from  general  tree  to binary  can  be done  in two stages.\\n\\uf0b7As a first  step,  we  delete  all the  branches  originating  in every\\nnode  except  the  left most  branch.  \\n\\uf0b7We  draw  edges  from  a  node  to  the  node  on  the  right,  if any,\\nwhich  is situated  at the  same  level. \\n\\uf0b7Once  this is done  then  for any particular  node,  we choose  its left\\nand  right  sons  in the  following  manner:\\n\\uf0b7The  left  son  is the  node,  which  is immediately  below  the\\ngiven  node,  and  the  right  son  is the  node  to the  immediate\\nright  of the  given  node  on the  same  horizontal  line.  Such  a\\nbinary  tree  will not have  a right  subtree.  \\nExample 1:\\nConvert (Encoding m-ary trees as binary trees)  the following ordered tree into a binary tree. \\n6 7 8 9 10 11 2 3 4 5 1 \\nSolution:\\nStage 1 tree using the above mentioned procedure is as follows:\\n6 7 8 9 10 11 2 3 4 5 1 \\nStage  2 tree  using  the  above  mentioned  procedure  is as follows:\\n1721 \\n2 \\n6 3 \\n7 8 4 \\n5 \\n9 \\n10 \\n11 \\nExample  2:\\nConstruct  a unique  binary  tree  from  the  given  forest.\\n4 5 6 8 9 \\n10 2 3 \\n11 7 1 \\n10 \\n12 13 \\nSolution:\\nStage 1 tree using the above mentioned procedure is as follows:\\n4 5 6 8 9 2 3 \\n11 7 1 \\n10 \\n12 13 \\nStage 2 tree using the above mentioned procedure is as follows (binary tree representation of forest):\\n1734 \\n5 6 8 \\n9 2 \\n3 7 1 \\n10 \\n12 \\n13 9 11 \\nSearch  and  Traversal  Techniques  for m-ary trees:\\nSearch involves visiting nodes in a tree in a systematic manner, and may or may not result into a visit\\nto all nodes. When the search necessarily involved the examination of every vertex in the tree, it is\\ncalled the traversal. Traversing of a tree can be done in two ways. \\n1.Depth  first  search  or traversal.\\n2.Breadth  first search  or traversal.\\nDepth  first  search:\\nIn  Depth  first  search,  we  begin  with  root  as  a  start  state,  then  some\\nsuccessor  of the  start  state,  then  some  successor  of that  state,  then  some\\nsuccessor  of that  and  so on, trying  to reach  a goal state.  One  simple  way\\nto  implement  depth  first  search  is  to  use  a  stack  data  structure\\nconsisting  of root  node  as a start  state.\\nIf depth  first  search  reaches  a state  S without  successors,  or  if all the\\nsuccessors  of a state  S have  been  chosen  (visited)  and  a goal  state  has\\nnot  get  been  found,  then  it  “backs  up”  that  means  it  goes  to  the\\nimmediately  previous  state  or  predecessor  formally,  the  state  whose\\nsuccessor  was  ‘S’ originally. \\nTo illustrate  this let us consider  the  tree  shown  below. \\nS  A D \\nE \\nB \\nC H  \\nF \\nI J \\nG  \\nK GOAL START \\nSuppose  S is the  start  and  G is the  only goal state.  Depth  first  search  will\\n174first  visit S, then  A, then  D. But D has  no successors,  so we must  back  up \\nto A and  try its second  successor,  E. But this doesn’t  have  any successors\\neither,  so we back  up to A again.  But now we have  tried  all the  \\nsuccessors  of A and  haven’t  found  the  goal state  G so we must  back  to \\n‘S’. Now  ‘S’ has  a second  successor,  B. But B has  no successors,  so we \\nback  up to S again  and  choose  its third  successor,  C. C has  one \\nsuccessor,  F. The first  successor  of F is H, and  the  first of H is J. J doesn’t\\nhave  any successors,  so we back  up to H and  try its second  successor.  \\nAnd that’s  G, the  only goal state.  \\nSo  the  solution  path  to  the  goal  is  S,  C,  F,  H  and  G and  the  states\\nconsidered  were  in order  S, A, D, E, B, C, F, H, J, G.\\nDisadvantages:  \\n1.It works  very  fine  when  search  graphs  are  trees  or lattices,  but\\ncan  get  struck  in  an  infinite  loop  on  graphs.  This  is because\\ndepth  first  search  can  travel  around  a  cycle  in  the  graph\\nforever.  \\nTo  eliminate  this  keep  a  list  of states  previously  visited,  and\\nnever  permit  search  to return  to any of them.\\n2.We cannot  come  up with shortest  solution  to the  problem.\\nBreadth  first  search:\\nBreadth-first search starts at root node S and “discovers\" which vertices are reachable from S.\\nBreadth-first search discovers vertices in increasing order of distance. Breadth-first search is named\\nbecause it visits vertices across the entire breadth. \\nTo illustrate this let us consider the following tree:\\nS  A D \\nE \\nB \\nC H  \\nF \\nI J \\nG  \\nK GOAL START \\nBreadth  first  search  finds  states  level by level. Here  we first  check  all the\\nimmediate  successors  of  the  start  state.  Then  all  the  immediate\\nsuccessors  of these,  then  all the  immediate  successors  of these,  and  so\\non  until  we  find  a goal  node.  Suppose  S is the  start  state  and  G is the\\ngoal state.  In the  figure,  start  state  S is at level 0; A, B and  C are  at level\\n1; D, e and  F at level 2; H and  I at level 3; and  J, G and  K at level 4. \\n175So breadth  first  search,  will consider  in order  S, A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J\\nand  G and  then  stop  because  it has  reached  the  goal node.  \\nBreadth  first  search  does  not  have  the  danger  of infinite  loops  as  we\\nconsider  states  in order  of increasing  number  of branches  (level)  from\\nthe  start  state.  \\nOne  simple  way to implement  breadth  first  search  is to use  a queue  data\\nstructure  consisting  of just a start  state.  \\n7.8.Sparse Matrices:\\nA sparse matrix is a two–dimensional array having the value of majority elements as\\nnull. The density of the matrix is the number of non-zero elements divided by the\\ntotal number of matrix elements. The matrices with very low density are often good\\nfor use of the sparse format. For example,\\n\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\n\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\n\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\n\\uf0eb\\uf0eb\\n\\uf03d\\n0400003100205000\\nA\\nAs far as the storage of a sparse matrix is concerned, storing of null elements is\\nnothing but wastage of memory. So we should devise technique such that only non-\\nnull elements will be stored.\\nThe matrix A produces:\\n(3, 1)1\\n(2, 2) 2\\nS =(3, 2)3\\n(4, 3)4\\n(1, 4)5\\nThe printed output lists the non-zero elements of S, together with their row and\\ncolumn indices. The elements are sorted by columns, reflecting the internal data\\nstructure.\\nIn large number of applications, sparse matrices are involved. One approach is to\\nuse the linked list. \\nThe  program  to represent  sparse  matrix:\\n/* Check  whether  the  given  matrix is sparse  matrix  or not, if so then  \\nprint  in alternative  form  for storage. */\\n#  include  <stdio.h>\\n#  include  <conio.h>\\n176main()\\n{\\nint matrix[20][20],  m, n, total_elements,  total_zeros  =  0, i, j;\\nclrscr();\\nprintf(\"\\\\n  Enter  Number  of rows  and  columns:  \");\\nscanf(\"%d  %d\",&m,  &n);\\ntotal_elements  =  m * n;\\nprintf(\"\\\\n  Enter  data  for sparse  matrix: \");\\nfor(i =  0; i <  m ; i++)\\n{\\nfor( j =  0; j <  n ; j++)\\n{\\nscanf(\"%d\", &matrix[i][j]);\\nif( matrix[i][j] ==  0)\\n{\\ntotal_zeros++;\\n}\\n}\\n}\\nif(total_zeros  >  total_elements/2  )\\n{\\nprintf(\"\\\\n  Given  Matrix is Sparse  Matrix..\");\\n      printf(\"\\\\n  The Representaion  of Sparse  Matrix is: \\\\n\");\\nprintf(\"\\\\n  Row \\\\t Col \\\\t Value  \");\\nfor(i =  0; i <  m ; i++)\\n{\\nfor( j =  0; j <  n ; j++)\\n{\\nif( matrix[i][j] !=  0)\\n{\\nprintf(\"\\\\n  %d \\\\t %d \\\\t %d\",i,j,matrix[i][j]);\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n}\\nelse\\nprintf(\"\\\\n  Given  Matrix is Not a Sparse  Matrix..\");\\n}\\n177LECTURE  NOTES\\non\\nDATA STRUCTURES\\n2018  – 2019\\nI B.
